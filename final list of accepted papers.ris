AB  - An ontology, a formal representation of domain knowledge, is an integral building block of the semantic web and is important in building an application within interdisciplinary domains. In the food domain, regulations require Food Business Operators (FBOs) to comply with traceability and track-ability measures when handling food in order to assess risk. In this paper, we identify several requirements to model food, food history, and risk of contamination in order to support the safety regulations of food. Using those requirements, we also identify and apply several design principles for building an ontology called prFood that encompasses interdisciplinary domains, food and risk. In order to apply safe handling of food in the food supply chain, we integrate and incorporate the pre-existing food ontologies with prFood by implementing a mapping procedure. Finally, we validate our approach by answering several use cases derived from EU and/or UK Food Regulations.

AB  - With the increased use of AI methods to provide recommendations in the health, specifically in the food dietary recommendation space, there is also an increased need for explainability of those recommendations. Such explanations would benefit users of recommendation systems by empowering them with justifications for following the system's suggestions. We present the Food Explanation Ontology (FEO) that provides a formalism for modeling explanations to users for food-related recommendations. FEO models food recommendations, using concepts from the explanation domain to create responses to user questions about food recommendations they receive from AI systems such as personalized knowledge base question answering systems. FEO uses a modular, extensible structure that lends itself to a variety of explanations while still preserving important semantic details to accurately represent explanations of food recommendations. In order to evaluate this system, we used a set of competency questions derived from explanation types present in literature that are relevant to food recommendations. Our motivation with the use of FEO is to empower users to make decisions about their health, fully equipped with an understanding of the AI recommender systems as they relate to user questions, by providing reasoning behind their recommendations in the form of explanations.

AB  - In this paper the authors present the design and development of a counseling system for food or menu planning in a restaurant, clinic/hospital, or at home, the Food-Oriented Ontology-Driven System (FOODS). FOODS comprises (a) a food ontology, (b) an expert system using the ontology, and some knowledge about cooking methods and prices, and (c) a user interface suitable for novices in computers and diets as well as for experts. The ontology contains specifications of ingredients, substances, nutrition facts, recommended daily intakes for different regions, dishes, and menus. The expert system assists in finding the appropriate dish or menu for the consumer, client or customer, who use FOODS by entering their favorite ingredients, ingredients to avoid, favorite flavors, and so on. In the health section users can provide their gender, age, height and weight, which will be used to calculate such data as the body mass index. With FOODS enterprises can assist customers through an appropriate suggestion of dishes and meals with the help of individual nutritional profiles. SMEs that might be interested in using FOODS are institutions for training and instruction of cooking, restaurants, clinics, hospitals, together with clinical and therapeutical dietitians and nutritional therapists. In the long run such systems might become part of the emerging consumer health informatics portfolio.

AB  - As pointed at LIVESTRONG.COM, Olympic weightlifters are quite possibly the strongest and most skilled lifters on earth. The ability to put nearly 300 kg over head or clean and jerk three times their bodyweight is feat of strength unmatched in other sports. While this takes years of dedicated training, diet is also critical as optimal nutrition is essential for peak performance. Nutritional misinformation can do as much harm to the ambitious athlete as good nutrition can help. In this study, we propose ontology-based personalized dietary recommendation for weightlifting to assist athletes meet their requirements. This paper describes a food and nutrition ontology working with a rule-based knowledge framework to provide specific menus for different times of the day and different training phases for the athlete’s diary nutritional needs and personal preferences. The main components of this system are the food and nutrition ontology, the athletes’ profiles and nutritional rules for sports athletes.

AB  - Background: As a prevalent metabolic disease, diabetes has different side effects and causes a wide range of co morbidity with a high rate of mortality. There is a need for certain interventions to manage this disease. Iranians usually have three main meals a day. Considering the special needs of diabetic patients and the possibility of hypoglycemia between the main meals, it is essential for these patients to eat something as a snack. Considering these conditions and the society’s orientation towards modern technologies such as smart phones, designing mobile-based nutrition recommender systems can be helpful.
Methods: The snack recommender system is a knowledge-based smart phone application. This study has focused on the development of a recommender system that combines artificial intelligence techniques and makes up a knowledge base according to the guidelines posed by the American Diabetes Association (ADA). The snack menu was recommended in accordance with the patient’s favorites and conditions. The accuracy of the recommended menu was assessed in 2 steps. First, it was compared with the diet prescribed by three nutrition specialists. In the second step, system’s suggested menu was evaluated by the data from 30 diabetic patients using a valid questionnaire.
Results: The results of evaluating the snack recommender system by nutritionists showed that this system is capable of recommending various snacks according to the season (accuracy of 100%) and personal interests (accuracy of 90%) to diabetic patients. According to health nutritionists, the snacks suggested by this system are matched with Iranian culture. Moreover, the results revealed that a higher body mass index (BMI) makes the recommender system less sensitive to personal interests to suggest what is basically beneficial for one’s health.
Conclusion: This study was a pioneering research to develop a more comprehensive dietary recommender system for diabetic patients which includes main meals as well. Patients found the system useful and were satisfied with the application. This system is believed to be able to help diabetic patients to take more healthy diet which leads to a better lifestyle.

AB  - The proliferation of recipes and other food information on the Web presents an opportunity for discovering and organizing dietrelated knowledge into a knowledge graph. Currently, there are several ontologies related to food, but they are specialized in speci c domains, e.g., from an agricultural, production, or speci c health condition pointof-view. There is a lack of a uni ed knowledge graph that is oriented towards consumers who want to eat healthily, and who need an integrated food suggestion service that encompasses food and recipes that they encounter on a day-to-day basis, along with the provenance of the information they receive. Our resource contribution is a software toolkit that can be used to create a uni ed food knowledge graph that links the various silos related to food while preserving the provenance information. We describe the construction process of our knowledge graph, the plan for its maintenance, and how this knowledge graph has been utilized in several applications. These applications include a SPARQL-based service that lets a user determine what recipe to make based on ingredients at hand while taking constraints such as allergies into account, as well as a cognitive agent that can perform natural language question answering on the knowledge graph.

AB  - In recent years, telehealthcare systems (TSs) have become more and more widespread, as they can contribute to promoting the continuity of care and managing chronic conditions efficiently. Most TSs and nutrition recommendation systems require much information to return appropriate suggestions. This work proposes an ontology-based TS, namely HeNuALs, aimed at fostering a healthy diet and an active lifestyle in older adults with chronic pathologies. The system is built on the formalization of users' health conditions, which can be obtained by leveraging existing standards. This allows for modeling different pathologies via reusable knowledge, thus limiting the amount of information needed to retrieve nutritional indications from the system. HeNuALs is composed of (1) an ontological layer that stores patients and their data, food and its characteristics, and physical activity-related data, enabling the inference a series of suggestions based on the effects of foods and exercises on specific health conditions; (2) two applications that allow both the patient and the clinicians to access the data (with different permissions) stored in the ontological layer; and (3) a series of wearable sensors that can be used to monitor physical exercise (provided by the patient application) and to ensure patients' safety. HeNuALs inferences have been validated considering two different use cases. The system revealed the ability to determine suggestions for healthy, adequate, or unhealthy dishes for a patient with respiratory disease and for a patient with diabetes mellitus. Future work foresees the extension of the HeNuALs knowledge base by exploiting automatic knowledge retrieval approaches and validation of the whole system with target users.

AB  - As society develops and science and technology improve, people have come to care more about a healthy diet. Diet types have gradually changed and focused more on health management. Taiwan is becoming an aging society in which individuals have irregular lifestyles, long-term unhealthy diets, stressful work, and chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol. However, most dietary recommendation systems cannot give dietary recommendations for patients with chronic diseases. Though healthy foods are recommended, the systems contain little information on whether nutrients are in balance. Therefore, this study constructed a diet recommendation system for chronic diseases using expert knowledge, which enables more convenient and precise dietary recommendations for chronic diseases. In this study, we use an ontology, decision trees, and Jena to construct the recommendation system. The dietary recommendations results are evaluated by dietitians, and the verification accuracy is 100%. Therefore, this system of dietary recommendations can provide convenient, healthy, dietary recommendations for nutrients for patients with chronic diseases.

AB  - Obesity is considered an epidemic that is continuously growing around the world. Heart diseases, diabetes, and bone and joint diseases are some of the diseases that people who are overweight or obese can develop. One of the vital causes of those disorders is poor nutrition education; there is no raising awareness about eating healthy food and practicing physical activities to burn off the excess energy. Therefore, it is necessary to use new technologies to build methods/tools that help people to overcome these avoidable nutrition disorders. For this reason, we implemented a recommendation engine capable of identifying the different levels of overweight and obesity in users and providing dietary strategies to mitigate them. To do so, we defined the Ontology of Dietary Recommendations (ODR) with axioms to model recipes, ingredients, and a set of diets to assist people who suffer from obesity. We validated the defined model by using a real set of individuals who were anonymized. A panel of advisors evaluated each individual record and suggested the most appropriate diets from those included in the ontology. Then, the proposed system was asked to also provide diet recommendations for each individual, which were compared with those proposed by the advisors (ground truth), reaching a mean accuracy of 87%. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Current food recommender systems tend to prioritize either the user’s dietary preferences or the healthiness of the food, without considering the importance of personalized health requirements. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to healthy food recommendations that takes into account the user’s personalized health requirements, in addition to their dietary preferences. Our work comprises three perspectives. Firstly, we propose a collaborative recipe knowledge graph ((Formula presented.)) with millions of triplets, containing user–recipe interactions, recipe–ingredient associations, and other food-related information. Secondly, we define a score-based method for evaluating the healthiness match between recipes and user preferences. Based on these two prior perspectives, we develop a novel health-aware food recommendation model ((Formula presented.)) using knowledge graph embedding and multi-task learning. (Formula presented.) employs a knowledge-aware attention graph convolutional neural network to capture the semantic associations between users and recipes on the collaborative knowledge graph and learns the user’s requirements in both preference and health by fusing the losses of these two learning tasks. We conducted experiments to demonstrate that (Formula presented.) outperformed four competing baseline models in integrating users’ dietary preferences and personalized health requirements in food recommendations and performed best on the health task. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - In food diet communication domain, images convey important information to capture users' attention beyond the traditional ingredient content, making it crucial to influence user-decision about the relevancy of a given diet. By using a deep learning-based image clustering method, this paper proposes an Explainable Food Recommendation system that uses the visual content of food to justify their recommendations. n the recommendation system. Especially, a new similarity score based on a tendency measure that quantifies the extent to which user community prefers a given food category is introduced and incorporated in the recommendation. Finally, a rule-based explainability is introduced to enhance transparency and interpretability of the recommendation outcome. Our experiments on a crawled dataset showed that the proposed method enhances recommendation quality in terms of precision, recall, F1, and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) by 7.35%, 6.70%, 7.32% and 14.38%, respectively, when compared to other existing methodologies for food recommendation. Besides ablation study is performed to demonstrate the technical soundness of the various components of our recommendation system. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Background: Dysphagia is a disorder that can be associated to several pathological conditions, including neuromuscular diseases, with significant impact on quality of life. Dysphagia often leads to malnutrition, as a consequence of the dietary changes made by patients or their caregivers, who may deliberately decide to reduce or avoid specific food consistencies (because they are not perceived as safe), and the lack of knowledge in how to process foods are critics. Such dietary changes often result in unbalanced nutrients intake, which can have significant consequences for frail patients. This paper presents the development of a prototypical novel ontologybased Decision Support System (DSS) to support neuromuscular patients with dysphagia (following a per-oral nutrition) and their caregivers in preparing nutritionally balanced and safe meals. Method: After reviewing scientific literature, we developed in collaboration with Ear-Nose-Throat (ENT) specialists, neurologists, and dieticians the DSS formalizes expert knowledge to suggest recipes that are considered safe according to patient's consistency limitations and dysphagia severity and also nutritionally well-balanced. Results: The prototype can be accessed via digital applications both by physicians to generate and verify the recommendations, and by the patients and their caregivers to follow the step-by-step procedures to autonomously prepare and process one or more recipe. The system is evaluated with 9 clinicians to assess the quality of the DSS's suggested recipes and its acceptance in clinical practice. Conclusions: Preliminary results suggest a global positive outcome for the recipes inferred by the DSS and a good usability of the system.

AB  - Background: Treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex problem. A clinical decision support system (CDSS) based on massive and distributed electronic health record data can facilitate the automation of this process and enhance its accuracy. The most important component of any CDSS is its knowledge base. This knowledge base can be formulated using ontologies. The formal description logic of ontology supports the inference of hidden knowledge. Building a complete, coherent, consistent, interoperable, and sharable ontology is a challenge. Results: This paper introduces the first version of the newly constructed Diabetes Mellitus Treatment Ontology (DMTO) as a basis for shared-semantics, domain-specific, standard, machine-readable, and interoperable knowledge relevant to T2DM treatment. It is a comprehensive ontology and provides the highest coverage and the most complete picture of coded knowledge about T2DM patients' current conditions, previous profiles, and T2DM-related aspects, including complications, symptoms, lab tests, interactions, treatment plan (TP) frameworks, and glucose-related diseases and medications. It adheres to the design principles recommended by the Open Biomedical Ontologies Foundry and is based on ontological realism that follows the principles of the Basic Formal Ontology and the Ontology for General Medical Science. DMTO is implemented under Protégé 5.0 in Web Ontology Language (OWL) 2 format and is publicly available through the National Center for Biomedical Ontology's BioPortal at http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/DMTO. The current version of DMTO includes more than 10,700 classes, 277 relations, 39,425 annotations, 214 semantic rules, and 62,974 axioms. We provide proof of concept for this approach to modeling TPs. Conclusion: The ontology is able to collect and analyze most features of T2DM as well as customize chronic TPs with the most appropriate drugs, foods, and physical exercises. DMTO is ready to be used as a knowledge base for semantically intelligent and distributed CDSS systems. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - The epidemic of diabetes in American Indian (AI) communities is a serious public health challenge. The incidence and prevalence of diabetes have increased dramatically with accompanying increases in body weight and diminished physical activity. In this paper, we propose a proactive diabetes self-care recommendation system specifically for AI patients. It recommends healthy life style to users to fight for their diabetes. Thanks to the quasi-ubiquitous use of cellphones in most AI tribes, we choose cellphones as the platform to provide smart personal care for AI patients. By integrating the AI users' ontological profile with general clinical diabetes recommendation and guidelines, the system can make personalized recommendations (e.g., food intake and physical workout) based on the special socioeconomic, cultural, and geographical status particularly to AI patients. The proposed system was implemented as mobile applications. Evaluations performed by use case studies and human expert verification demonstrate the effectiveness of the system.

AB  - Vegetable crop farmers diversify their production by growing a range of crops during the season on the same plot. Crop diversification and rotation enables farmers to increase their income and crop yields while enhancing their farm sustainability against climatic events and pest attacks. Farmers must plan their agricultural work per year and over successive years. Planning decisions are made on the basis of their experience regarding previous plans. For the purpose of assisting farmers in planning decisions and monitoring, we developed the Crop Planning and Production Process Ontology (C3PO), i.e., a representation of agricultural knowledge and data for diversified crop production. C3PO is composed of eight modules to capture all crop production dimensions and complexity for representing farming practices and constraints. It encodes agricultural processes and farm plot organization and captures common agricultural knowledge. C3PO introduces a representation of technical itineraries, i.e., sequences of technical farming tasks to grow vegetables, from soil identification and seed selection to harvest and storage. C3PO is the backbone of a knowledge graph which aggregates data from heterogeneous related semantic resources, e.g., organism taxonomies, chemicals, reference crop listings, or development stages. C3PO and its knowledge graph are used by the Elzeard enterprise to develop knowledge-based decision support systems for farmers. This article describes how we built C3PO and its knowledge graph—which are both publicly available—and briefly outlines their applications.

AB  - Aquaponics, one of the vertical farming methods, is a combination of aquaculture and hydroponics. To enhance the production capabilities of the aquaponics system and maximize crop yield on a commercial level, integration of Industry 4.0 technologies is needed. Industry 4.0 is a strategic initiative characterized by the fusion of emerging technologies such as big data and analytics, internet of things, robotics, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. The realization of aquaponics 4.0, however, requires an efficient flow and integration of data due to the presence of complex biological processes. A key challenge in this essence is to deal with the semantic heterogeneity of multiple data resources. An ontology that is regarded as one of the normative tools solves the semantic interoperation problem by describing, extracting, and sharing the domains' knowledge. In the field of agriculture, several ontologies are developed for the soil-based farming methods, but so far, no attempt has been made to represent the knowledge of the aquaponics 4.0 system in the form of an ontology model. Therefore, this study proposes a unified ontology model, AquaONT, to rep-resent and store the essential knowledge of an aquaponics 4.0 system. This ontology pro-vides a mechanism for sharing and reusing the aquaponics 4.0 system's knowledge to solve the semantic interoperation problem. AquaONT is built from indoor vertical farming terminologies and is validated and implemented by considering experimental test cases related to environmental parameters, design configuration, and product quality. The proposed ontology model will help vertical farm practitioners with more transparent decision -making regarding crop production, product quality, and facility layout of the aquaponics farm. For future work, a decision support system will be developed using this ontology model and artificial intelligence techniques for autonomous data-driven decisions.(c) 2021 China Agricultural University.

AB  - Storing the patient’s clinical test reports for analysis differs from clinic to clinic as most clinics store the details in customized software or freely available spreadsheets. In the nutrition test report, the test results show the levels, thresholds that doctors analyze and diagnose the type of deficiency. In many situations, the patients have a dilemma about the doctor’s advice that results in a second opinion. Hence a simple decision support system is a necessity to help the doctor to analyze the laboratory test report data and prescribe the right treatment. This research proposes a nutrition deficiency decision support framework that models a biochemistry test report using an ontology and automatic nutrition deficiency classification. The resulting system is useful in hospitals for the automatic classification of nutritional deficiency.

AB  - Lifestyle-related diseases can be reduced by making daily dietary choices. Functional components in foods have the potential to provide beneﬁts in this regard. We constructed a knowledge graph that connects the functional components of foods to recipes, and developed a recommendation system to suggest dishes that may help alleviate lifestyle-related diseases. As dietary requirements vary widely depending on speciﬁc diseases and individual conditions, these requirements are combined to form a vast probability distribution. Our proposed system uses probabilistic logic programming to generate recommendations that are based on disease-speciﬁc dietary requirements, using a knowledge graph of foods and information about the user’s condition. In the proposed method, nodes in the knowledge graph, such as food functionality or recipes, are characterized by their relationships with other surrounding nodes, such as ingredients. We conducted an experiment to suggest recipes speciﬁcally for patients with diabetes and dyslipidemia. At the result, our system enable to recommend numerous recipes beneﬁcial for the improvement of lifestyle-related diseases, especially for users with diabetes, with a precision of over 0.99.

AB  - A traceability tool is an asset to the supply chain, especially the food one. The supply chain involves various sources of data, which is essential for effective traceability. Hence, a traceability system should overcome the heterogeneous data integration issue. Therefore, this paper introduces an ontology that formalizes the traceability tasks and surroundings elements to exchange information. Thus, this article describes the main features of an Intelligent Traceability Ontology (ITO). This ontology represents the main relationships between traceability activities and the entities involved in these activities. Moreover, this modeling can be used not only for tracing and tracking product information but also for supervising the product's environment parameters.

AB  - The food industry has been growing with the tremendous improvements in information technologies. The way of accessing foods has become diversified with innovative technologies based on new generation semantic frameworks and interaction technologies. The proposed web-based platform, namely KEBAP, is based on a semantic framework modeled by a food and food stakeholder combined ontology. The platform is presented by a case study that utilizes an innovative interaction facility based on Virtual Reality (VR). The online platform encounters gastronomic, cultural, personal, and nutritional factors affecting personal preferences, eaters' health status and regarding stakeholders in gastronomy sector. The proposed platform enables online promotion of food, conscious consumption and ordering of food over Internet, semantic filtering of food data and effective presentation and simulation of food and its environment with VR. The presented platform is designed by considering big data requirements that makes the proposed solution scalable to larger beverage and appetite data.

AB  - Along with the massive influence of computational technologies in medical research and practice, the wide generation of patient, clinical and lab tests data make the assistance of intelligent information systems very important for correct therapy, surveillance and advising of the patient. Medical data is highly heterogeneous and with different structure and formats. Principal tasks of the work are focused at intelligent integration of all data related to a particular patient. Aside with the methodological aspects of linking medical data, an important part of the discussed study focuses on the design and development of a special purpose decision support system. This system enriches a specific ontology for diabetes mellitus with a set of newly defined rules, supporting the development of broad and more precise personalized dietary recommendations as a part of digitized healthcare assistance.

AB  - Recommender systems are needed to find food items of one’s interest. We propose a food personalization framework that assists the user with the actual diet selection process. The Ontology-based process, recommend an appropriate diet for the user. The system analyses the user’s queries based on their requirements and recommends diet, based on their diseases and deficiencies. The system is tested for its efficiency in terms of query processing for users nutrient requirements.

AB  - In the modern world, professionals of diverse industrial sectors have severely become victims of Obese and Overweight conditions. Obese and Overweight conditions can be minimized by having proper dietary plans, physical activities and minimizing alcohol-based relaxation. In this research context, we try to address the issue of having poor physical exercise. We guide professionals with suitable exercises to reduce their weight in order to have the required Body Mass Index(BMI). The user body measurements that are recommended by the domain experts to concern such as sex, height, weight, exercise preferences, age, diet details and medical history used to calculate the degree of obesity of each individual. Then the degree of obesity is mapped with the knowledge base along with the predefined rules in order to match respective exercises suitable for the particular individuals that are compatible with the user’s medical history. Two ontologies for foods and exercises were developed using Protégé 4.3.0 and were retrieved by running Simple Protocol and Resource Description Framework Query Language (SPARQL) queries. Python 3 is used as the backend language for ontology and interface integration. Frontend developed using Tkinter GUI in Python 3 and is presented for the users to ease the interaction with the system. Two ontological files of Foods and Exercises are loaded and tested for consistency using the HermiT reasoner with the aid of Owlready2. Accuracy and Correctness are checked by addressing the competency questions and by domain experts’ inspections.

AB  - In recent years, due to the development and advance in information science and technology, people care more about the healthy diet, so diet types gradually change and take more focus on health management. Nowadays, it is becoming an aging society in Taiwan people have irregular life, long-term unhealthy diet, work pressure and other factors to be chronic disease, such as diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol, and so on. However, most of the dietary recommendation system cannot give the dietary recommendations for patients of chronic diseases. The patients care what foods are edible, but they do not notify whether the nutrients are in balance. Therefore, this study built a diet recommendation system of chronic diseases with an expert knowledge, and gave chronic diseases more convenient and more precise dietary recommendations. In this study, we use ontology, decision tree and Jena to build the recommendation system. The dietary recommendations result is through assessment of dietitians, and verification accuracy is 100%. Therefore, this system of dietary recommendations can provide dietary recommendation of nutrient for patients of chronic diseases to achieve convenient and healthy diet.

AB  - A quality-oriented melon selection process is an important factor in increasing consumers willingness to pay. However, unlike most fruits, melons are usually sold whole, making it difficult to choose a perfectly ripe and sweet melon, as skin color and texture play an important role in this. From a marketing perspective, the selling power of melons is influenced by demand and supply. This paper presents a new approach by utilizing hidden semantic data on melon images derived from digital images. Semantic information on the surface of the melon is described, extracted, and shared as domain knowledge using an ontology approach that allows the relationship between parameters to produce descriptions and actions in determining the quality of the melon. Using K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to model the data that has been obtained from the visual data extraction process An information description approach using an ontology guided by KNN in determining the quality of the proposed melons can assist farmers in classifying quality melons at reasonable prices with limited human involvement.

AB  - The awareness and familiarity of elderly people with the use of new technologies have increased considerably in the last few years, which consequently cause a higher willingness to the use of these technologies in their daily lives. This allows the elderly to benefit from technology through active and conscious participation in activities related to health, leisure and promotion of social relationships, fostering active ageing. Three large dimensions cover almost a major part of health care within the framework of early and intermediate stages of active ageing: physical exercise, healthy nutrition and cognitive stimulation. In this paper, we present a nutritional recommender system, Nutrition for Elder Care, intended to help elderly users to draw up their own healthy diet plans following the nutritional experts guidelines. The system has been developed with the intensive use of Semantic Web technologies pursuing knowledge sharing and reuse between different applications and agents and the discovering of implicit new knowledge.

AB  - The daily useful nutrition needs become important information to be given to the society. Occurrence of many nutrition cases, such as obesity, overweight or even underweight, shows that the society have not been given an appropriate information about their recommended daily values for key nutrients and also the suggestion of their daily menus. In this paper, we design ontology-based daily menu assistance system using the Indonesian food as a case study. The ontology is a simple methodology to describe the concept of an expert system. We have used it to model a nutrition needs domain in the information of health control system. This methodology is used to advise the appropriate Indonesian food menus to anyone based on their personal data, calories needed, activity factor, and abstinence.

AB  - Abstract
            
              The construction of high capacity data sharing networks to support increasing government and commercial data exchange has highlighted a key roadblock: the content of existing Internet-connected information remains siloed due to a multiplicity of local languages and data dictionaries. This lack of a digital lingua franca is obvious in the domain of human food as materials travel from their wild or farm origin, through processing and distribution chains, to consumers. Well defined, hierarchical vocabulary, connected with logical relationships—in other words, an ontology—is urgently needed to help tackle data harmonization problems that span the domains of food security, safety, quality, production, distribution, and consumer health and convenience. FoodOn (
              http://foodon.org
              ) is a consortium-driven project to build a comprehensive and easily accessible global farm-to-fork ontology about food, that accurately and consistently describes foods commonly known in cultures from around the world. FoodOn addresses food product terminology gaps and supports food traceability. Focusing on human and domesticated animal food description, FoodOn contains animal and plant food sources, food categories and products, and other facets like preservation processes, contact surfaces, and packaging. Much of FoodOn’s vocabulary comes from transforming LanguaL, a mature and popular food indexing thesaurus, into a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) OWL Web Ontology Language-formatted vocabulary that provides system interoperability, quality control, and software-driven intelligence. FoodOn compliments other technologies facilitating food traceability, which is becoming critical in this age of increasing globalization of food networks.

AB  - Cooking is an important activity because food is one of the basic necessities of life. However, some ingredients are difficult to find in some seasons or some regions, therefore ingredient substitution is needed for real taste. This article presents a knowledge acquisition model for ingredient substitution by applying Thai cuisine recipe for a case study. The main purpose of this research is to substitute rare Thai ingredients using existing ingredients. The proposed model is applying the concept of domain ontology to design the entities and relations among these entities which are related to ingredient substitution in Thai cuisine recipe. In addition, a set of rule bases by Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) is designed and embedded into the ontology to apply for discovering the existing ingredients that can substitute the rare Thai ingredients.

AB  - People depend on popular search engines, like Google and Yahoo, to retrieve the desired information from the Web. Searching for the right food, to eat, is an example of the frequent queries on the Web where people do not find relevant information easily. One reason for this un-satisfaction is the fact that many people have personal preferences where each one likes and dislikes certain food. Also, some people have specific health conditions that restrict their food choices and encourage them to take other food. In addition, the cultures, where people live in, influence food choices and varieties. Therefore, it will be helpful to develop a framework that provides food recommendation, what to take and what to avoid, increasing the advantages and reducing the risks especially for people who have long term diseases such as diabetes and high-blood-pressure. Since health and nutrition information is critical and hence people need to get precise information from trusted sources. Furthermore, transforming the implied knowledge about health and nutrition into structured data is challenging, so developing a framework that semantically manipulate the health and nutrition information is becoming an increasingly important research topic. In this paper, we harness semantic Web and ontology engineering technologies to analyze user’s preferences, construct a nutritional and health oriented user’s profile, and use the profile to organize the related knowledge so that users can make smarter food and health inquires. We present a semantic framework that uses the personalization techniques based on integrated domain ontologies, pre-constructed by domain experts, to recommend the relevant food that is consistent with people’s needs. The empirical evaluation of the proposed framework shows promising results for recommending the relevant food information with a superior user’s satisfaction.

AB  - Life expectancy for the Thai population has increased in recent decades, and at the same time the birth is decreasing steadily. This creates problems for health care and treatment of the elderly, since there are not as many younger people around to take care of them. The Thai Government is initiating campaigns for the dissemination of knowledge and practices of appropriate nutrition and life style, e.g. physical exercise, for the elderly.

AB  - AI-based software applications for personalized nutrition have recently gained increasing attention to help users follow a healthy lifestyle. In this paper, we present a knowledge-based recommendation framework that exploits an explicit dataset of expert-validated meals to offer highly accurate diet plans spanning across ten user groups of both healthy subjects and participants with health conditions. The proposed advisor is built on a novel architecture that includes (a) a qualitative layer for verifying ingredient appropriateness, and (b) a quantitative layer for synthesizing meal plans. The ﬁrst layer is implemented as an expert system for fuzzy inference relying on an ontology of rules acquired by experts in Nutrition, while the second layer as an optimization method for generating daily meal plans based on target nutrient values and ranges. The system’s effectiveness is evaluated through extensive experiments for establishing meal and meal plan appropriateness, meal variety, as well as system capacity for recommending meal plans. Evaluations involved synthetic data, including the generation of 3000 virtual user proﬁles and their weekly meal plans. Results reveal a high precision and recall for recommending appropriate ingredients in most user categories, while the meal plan generator achieved a total recommendation accuracy of 92% for all nutrient recommendations.

AB  - Growing health awareness results in interest in healthy eating and “ﬁtness”. While information about exercising and dieting is readily accessible, it is difﬁcult, for an inexperienced person, to ﬁnd what is right for her/him in terms of both diet and exercise. The aim of this work is to introduce a system, based on semantic technologies, which addresses user goals with joint exercise programs and meal suggestions.
