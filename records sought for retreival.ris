AB  - Nutrition-related diseases can considerably contribute to many different health-related problems and can impact on several segments of the population. Promoting balanced diet plans is therefore pivotal; however, this is not a trivial task as it requires different stakeholders (nutrition experts, agro-industrial businesses and consumers) to cooperate. This work introduces a prototypical ontology-based decision support system to enable such a cooperation, allowing nutrition experts to rely on a support tool when developing diet plans, consumers to received tailored suggestions and to be informed regarding new food products that could have an effect on specific their health condition, and agro-industrial companies to divulge characteristics of novel food products and their expected effects. These stakeholders can also exchange comments, suggestions and observations. The decision support system relies on widely-adopted ontologies and its use is introduced by two scenarios. © 2020, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.

AB  - With the rapid increase in the world's population, there is an ever-growing need for a sustainable food supply. Agriculture is one of the pillars for worldwide food provisioning, with fruits and vegetables being essential for a healthy diet. However, in the last few years the worldwide dispersion of virulent plant pests and diseases has caused significant decreases in the yield and quality of crops, in particular fruit, cereal and vegetables. Climate change and the intensification of global trade flows further accentuate the issue. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is an approach to pest control that aims at maintaining pest insects at tolerable levels, keeping pest populations below an economic injury level. Under these circumstances, the early identification of pests and diseases becomes crucial. In this work, we present the first step towards a fully fledged, semantically enhanced decision support system for IPM. The ultimate goal is to build a complete agricultural knowledge base by gathering data from multiple, heterogeneous sources and to develop a system to assist farmers in decision making concerning the control of pests and diseases. The pest classifier framework has been evaluated in a simulated environment, obtaining an aggregated accuracy of 98.8%.

AB  - Crop leaf diseases pose a significant challenge to global agriculture, leading to substantial economic losses and reduced yields. These ailments, caused by various pathogens, manifest as symptoms such as leaf discoloration and impaired photosynthesis, severely impacting crop health and productivity. Existing classification methods face challenges related to accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability. This study introduces an innovative solution that combines a meticulously designed lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with a channel attention (CA) mechanism for extracting crucial features and leverages the discriminative power of an extreme learning machine (ELM) for classification. The lightweight CNN developed demonstrates significantly reduced training times. Additionally, the CA mechanism within the model effectively prioritizes channel-wise critical features while eliminating irrelevant and redundant ones. An empirical evaluation is conducted using a publicly available dataset and the proposed model achieves a flawless 100% accuracy in distinguishing between 39 distinct crop leaf diseases. Furthermore, the study employs gradient class activation maps (Grad-CAM) visualization to delve into the model’s decision-making process, shedding light on influential factors and regions. It holds the promise of transforming crop health and agricultural yields, instilling hope for farmers and researchers dedicated to achieving agricultural prosperity and sustainability.

AB  - Storing the patient's clinical test reports for analysis differs from clinic to clinic as most clinics store the details in customized software or freely available spreadsheets. In the nutrition test report, the test results show the levels, thresholds that doctors analyze and diagnose the type of deficiency. In many situations, the patients have a dilemma about the doctor's advice that results in a second opinion. Hence a simple decision support system is a necessity to help the doctor to analyze the laboratory test report data and prescribe the right treatment. This research proposes a nutrition deficiency decision support framework that models a biochemistry test report using an ontology and automatic nutrition deficiency classification. The resulting system is useful in hospitals for the automatic classification of nutritional deficiency.

AB  - Keeping healthy diet and lifestyle is the most effective way to prevent disease. But usually people only know some basic physical information like height, weight, heartbeat, and so on. They have no idea whether their food habit or lifestyle will affect their health. This paper, based on the scene of health cloud, proposes a knowledge reasoning model which includes knowledge analysis module, ontology modeling module, decision engine, rule engine and semantic template. The model provides a method which can analyze the diet and lifestyle information of people. And the information can be achieved from the domain ontology which is pretreated by domains experts. With the results of semantic reasoning processes, people can get some better healthy diet and lifestyle advices. An example of health diet has been constructed to test the performance of knowledge reasoning model. The results indicate that the model can effectively work for knowledge reasoning in health cloud.

TI  - Modular structure of web-based decision support systems for integrated pest management. A review
AU  - Damos, P.
T2  - Agronomy for Sustainable Development
AB  - Sustainable pest management implies less pesticide use and replacement by safe control alternatives. This requires decision support for rational pest management. However, in practice, successful decision making is dependent upon the availability of integrated, high-quality information. Computer-aided forecasting and related decision support systems make pest control more sustainable by avoiding unwanted consequences of pesticide applications. Here, I review integrated pest management for web-based decision support systems. The major points are the following: (1) Principles of integrated pest management are compatible with sustainable agriculture. (2) Pest models serve as basis of decision making because they offer means to predict the exact time of pest phenological development and initiate management actions. Most models are climate driven. (3) New hardware technology has permitted the registration of automatically recorded climatic data. This data can be combined with pest models through logical operations and forecasting algorithms to develop a software of pest management. (4) Dynamic web interfaces can serve as decision support systems providing the user with real-time pest warnings and recommendations for management actions. (5) Ontology web programing and semantic knowledge representations provide a way to classify and describe agrodata to facilitate information sharing and data exploitation over distributed systems. (6) Most available pest management data is published on static web pages and, thus, cannot be classified as decision support systems. Some web-based decision support systems provide user-interactive content and real-time pest forecasts and management support. © 2015, INRA and Springer-Verlag France.

AB  - In recent years, telehealthcare systems (TSs) have become more and more widespread, as they can contribute to promoting the continuity of care and managing chronic conditions efficiently. Most TSs and nutrition recommendation systems require much information to return appropriate suggestions. This work proposes an ontology-based TS, namely HeNuALs, aimed at fostering a healthy diet and an active lifestyle in older adults with chronic pathologies. The system is built on the formalization of users' health conditions, which can be obtained by leveraging existing standards. This allows for modeling different pathologies via reusable knowledge, thus limiting the amount of information needed to retrieve nutritional indications from the system. HeNuALs is composed of (1) an ontological layer that stores patients and their data, food and its characteristics, and physical activity-related data, enabling the inference a series of suggestions based on the effects of foods and exercises on specific health conditions; (2) two applications that allow both the patient and the clinicians to access the data (with different permissions) stored in the ontological layer; and (3) a series of wearable sensors that can be used to monitor physical exercise (provided by the patient application) and to ensure patients' safety. HeNuALs inferences have been validated considering two different use cases. The system revealed the ability to determine suggestions for healthy, adequate, or unhealthy dishes for a patient with respiratory disease and for a patient with diabetes mellitus. Future work foresees the extension of the HeNuALs knowledge base by exploiting automatic knowledge retrieval approaches and validation of the whole system with target users.

T2  - Technology and Health Care
AB  - BACKGROUND: Humans supply a variety of nutrients to their body in dietary life, which are directly related to health. Chronic diseases are long accumulated in the body on account of heredity or living habits, and draw attention as a main issue in the era of disease-controlled longevity. Therefore, it is essential to make health care continuously through the improvement in dietary habits. OBJECTIVE: By recommending alternative food products whose diet and nutrition structure is similar to that of the food products positively influencing users' health conditions, it is possible to satisfy user's health and preference. METHOD: We used the hybrid clustering based food recommendation method that uses chronic disease based clustering, diet and nutrition ontology, diet and nutrition knowledge base. Active users are classified into the chronic disease based cluster that has the nearest euclidean distance. According to the classified clusters, food products are recommended to users, and similar food products are also recommended with the use of food clustering and knowledge base. Food products are clustered with the uses of k-means algorithm and food and nutrient data system. Based on the created food clusters and food preference data, diet and nutrition knowledge base is generated. It is composed of food cluster filter, food similarity filter, universal preference filter, and user feedback filter. The universal preference filter represents the similarity weight between diet and nutrition, and user preference. The user feedback filter has the similarity weight between active user preference and diet and nutrition. They continue to be updated through associated feedback. RESULT: The proposed health decision-making method takes into account each user's health condition so that the method has more precision than an existing recommendation method. In addition, the proposed method brings about better evaluation results than a general user-by-user health context information based recommendation method. CONCLUSION: By recommending the food products related to users' chronic diseases through the proposed hybrid clustering, it is possible to help out their healthcare. In addition, by letting users receive satisfying feedback flexibly, it is possible to improve their dietary habits. © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

AB  - Management of pests is an important task in agriculture. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a way to prevent pest risks for long term using effective methods. Use of IoT for integrated pest management is unavoidable as it involves various tools from biological, chemical, mechanical and cultural field. Information about pests and all these tools needs to be maintained. Storing this information as ontology is the best option, as it then can be used by number of automated systems in agricultural field. Information in terms of ontology can be used by web services and can be made available online. It will help not only researchers in agriculture field but also farmers to manage pests and improve yield percentage. We describe automated method for construction of IPM ontology as web ontology language document and explain how it can be made available to farmers as an IoT application.

Nowadays, it is becoming an aging society in Taiwan people have irregular life, long-term unhealthy diet, work pressure and other factors to be chronic disease, such as diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol, and so on. However, most of the dietary recommendation system cannot give the dietary recommendations for patients of chronic diseases. The patients care what foods are edible, but they do not notify whether the nutrients are in balance. Therefore, this study built a diet recommendation system of chronic diseases with an expert knowledge, and gave chronic diseases more convenient and more precise dietary recommendations. In this study, we use ontology, decision tree and Jena to build the recommendation system. The dietary recommendations result is through assessment of dietitians, and verification accuracy is 100%. Therefore, this system of dietary recommendations can provide dietary recommendation of nutrient for patients of chronic diseases to achieve convenient and healthy diet.

AB  - Lifestyle-related diseases can be reduced by making daily dietary choices. Functional components in foods have the potential to provide benefits in this regard. We constructed a knowledge graph that connects the functional components of foods to recipes, and developed a recommendation system to suggest dishes that may help alleviate lifestyle-related diseases. As dietary requirements vary widely depending on specific diseases and individual conditions, these requirements are combined to form a vast probability distribution. Our proposed system uses probabilistic logic programming to generate recommendations that are based on disease-specific dietary requirements, using a knowledge graph of foods and information about the user’s condition. In the proposed method, nodes in the knowledge graph, such as food functionality or recipes, are characterized by their relationships with other surrounding nodes, such as ingredients. We conducted an experiment to suggest recipes specifically for patients with diabetes and dyslipidemia. At the result, our system enable to recommend numerous recipes beneficial for the improvement of lifestyle-related diseases, especially for users with diabetes, with a precision of over 0.99.

AB  - Obesity is considered an epidemic that is continuously growing around the world. Heart diseases, diabetes, and bone and joint diseases are some of the diseases that people who are overweight or obese can develop. One of the vital causes of those disorders is poor nutrition education; there is no raising awareness about eating healthy food and practicing physical activities to burn off the excess energy. Therefore, it is necessary to use new technologies to build methods/tools that help people to overcome these avoidable nutrition disorders. For this reason, we implemented a recommendation engine capable of identifying the different levels of overweight and obesity in users and providing dietary strategies to mitigate them. To do so, we defined the Ontology of Dietary Recommendations (ODR) with axioms to model recipes, ingredients, and a set of diets to assist people who suffer from obesity. We validated the defined model by using a real set of individuals who were anonymized. A panel of advisors evaluated each individual record and suggested the most appropriate diets from those included in the ontology. Then, the proposed system was asked to also provide diet recommendations for each individual, which were compared with those proposed by the advisors (ground truth), reaching a mean accuracy of 87%. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Current food recommender systems tend to prioritize either the user’s dietary preferences or the healthiness of the food, without considering the importance of personalized health requirements. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to healthy food recommendations that takes into account the user’s personalized health requirements, in addition to their dietary preferences. Our work comprises three perspectives. Firstly, we propose a collaborative recipe knowledge graph ((Formula presented.)) with millions of triplets, containing user–recipe interactions, recipe–ingredient associations, and other food-related information. Secondly, we define a score-based method for evaluating the healthiness match between recipes and user preferences. Based on these two prior perspectives, we develop a novel health-aware food recommendation model ((Formula presented.)) using knowledge graph embedding and multi-task learning. (Formula presented.) employs a knowledge-aware attention graph convolutional neural network to capture the semantic associations between users and recipes on the collaborative knowledge graph and learns the user’s requirements in both preference and health by fusing the losses of these two learning tasks. We conducted experiments to demonstrate that (Formula presented.) outperformed four competing baseline models in integrating users’ dietary preferences and personalized health requirements in food recommendations and performed best on the health task. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - In this world, for any kind of information, people depend on internet. They use search engines like Google to search information over internet. The queries that are written on the web must be accurate which would give the relevant information related to user's Health Care. But there is huge amount of information on the internet and so it's difficult to get the relevant information easily. In case of searches on right food exercise, people usually have their own preferences. Also people who suffers from some medical conditions they are restricted to some foods and exercises so they are attracted towards other food and exercises. Also the civilization where people reside will have impact on the number of choices and varieties of food. So there is need for easy to use framework for food and exercise recommendation. We propose ontology based semantic framework Health Care recommendation system which will provide precise information based on users requirements and constraints. This framework will use semantic web technology to analyze user's preferences and will build a nourished and health associated use's profile and will use the profile to categorize the associated knowledge so that users can make delicious food and exercise inquiries. We will also use the Decision Tree algorithm for retrieving related information from the database.

AB  - In food diet communication domain, images convey important information to capture users' attention beyond the traditional ingredient content, making it crucial to influence user-decision about the relevancy of a given diet. By using a deep learning-based image clustering method, this paper proposes an Explainable Food Recommendation system that uses the visual content of food to justify their recommendations. n the recommendation system. Especially, a new similarity score based on a tendency measure that quantifies the extent to which user community prefers a given food category is introduced and incorporated in the recommendation. Finally, a rule-based explainability is introduced to enhance transparency and interpretability of the recommendation outcome. Our experiments on a crawled dataset showed that the proposed method enhances recommendation quality in terms of precision, recall, F1, and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) by 7.35%, 6.70%, 7.32% and 14.38%, respectively, when compared to other existing methodologies for food recommendation. Besides ablation study is performed to demonstrate the technical soundness of the various components of our recommendation system. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - With the increased use of AI methods to provide recommendations in the health, specifically dietary recommendation space, there is also an increased need for explainability of those recommendations. Such explanations would benefit users of recommendation systems by empowering them with justifications for following the system's suggestions. We present the Food Explanation Ontology (FEO) that provides a formalism for modeling explanations to users for food-related recommendations. FEO models food recommendations, using concepts from the explanation domain to create responses to user questions about food recommendations they receive from AI systems such as personalized knowledge base question answering systems. FEO uses a modular, extensible structure that lends itself to a variety of explanations while still preserving important semantic details to accurately represent explanations of food recommendations. In order to evaluate this system, we used a set of competency questions derived from explanation types present in literature that are relevant to food recommendations. Our motivation with the use of FEO is to empower users to make decisions about their health, fully equipped with an understanding of the AI recommender systems as they relate to user questions, by providing reasoning behind their recommendations in the form of explanations.

AB  - Background: Dysphagia is a disorder that can be associated to several pathological conditions, including neuromuscular diseases, with significant impact on quality of life. Dysphagia often leads to malnutrition, as a consequence of the dietary changes made by patients or their caregivers, who may deliberately decide to reduce or avoid specific food consistencies (because they are not perceived as safe), and the lack of knowledge in how to process foods are critics. Such dietary changes often result in unbalanced nutrients intake, which can have significant consequences for frail patients. This paper presents the development of a prototypical novel ontologybased Decision Support System (DSS) to support neuromuscular patients with dysphagia (following a per-oral nutrition) and their caregivers in preparing nutritionally balanced and safe meals. Method: After reviewing scientific literature, we developed in collaboration with Ear-Nose-Throat (ENT) specialists, neurologists, and dieticians the DSS formalizes expert knowledge to suggest recipes that are considered safe according to patient's consistency limitations and dysphagia severity and also nutritionally well-balanced. Results: The prototype can be accessed via digital applications both by physicians to generate and verify the recommendations, and by the patients and their caregivers to follow the step-by-step procedures to autonomously prepare and process one or more recipe. The system is evaluated with 9 clinicians to assess the quality of the DSS's suggested recipes and its acceptance in clinical practice. Conclusions: Preliminary results suggest a global positive outcome for the recipes inferred by the DSS and a good usability of the system.

AB  - Recommender systems are currently a relevant tool for facilitating access for online users, to information items in search spaces overloaded with possible options. With this goal in mind, they have been used in diverse domains such as e-commerce, e-learning, e-tourism, e-health, etc. Specifically, in the case of the e-health scenario, the computer science community has been focused on building recommender systems tools for supporting personalized nutrition by delivering user-tailored foods and menu recommendations, incorporating the health-aware dimension to a larger or lesser extent. However, it has been also identified the lack of a comprehensive analysis of the recent advances specifically focused on food recommendations for the domain of diabetic patients. This topic is particularly relevant, considering that in 2021 it was estimated that 537 million adults were living with diabetes, being unhealthy diets a major risk factor that leads to such an issue. This paper is centered on presenting a survey of food recommender systems for diabetic patients, supported by the PRISMA 2020 framework, and focused on characterizing the strengths and weaknesses of the research developed in this direction. The paper also introduces future directions that can be followed in the next future, for guaranteeing progress in this necessary research area. © 2023 by the authors.

TI  - Semantic-based Thai Recipe Recommendation
AU  - Chotipant, Supannada
T2  - 2022 19th International Joint Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering (JCSSE)
AB  - Nowadays, people are constantly affected by epidemics such as COVID-19. To reduce the risk of acquiring germs in the community, people's lifestyles have been changed, and they are more inclined to cook for themselves. Typically, people can usually quickly and easily find recipe information via websites and applications. The resulting recipes consist of ingredients as specified by the user. Unfortunately, users often have ingredients that disappear in available cooking recipes. This makes the system is unable to recommend all relevant recipes to users, although the users can use the existing ingredients instead of the ingredients specified in the recipes. Based on this limitation, this research proposes a semantic-based Thai cooking recipe recommendation system which can recommend recipes based on the ingredient substitutes. This research uses existing Thai food ontology to retrieve substitute ingredients based on three different ingredient properties, such as smell, taste, and texture. To recommend cooking recipes, the system expands the given user queries with substitute ingredients and then calculates similarities between all queries and each cooking recipe. Recipes with high similarities are presented and ranked to users. To evaluate the performances, precision, recall and f-measure are applied. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method performs well with 0.96, 0.72, and 0.82 in precision, recall, and f-measure respectively.

AB  - The Semantic Web technology is an efficient mechanism to query or infer knowledge on a global scale using the internet by providing logical reasoning through rule based system. In this paper application of semantic web technology is discussed in context of agriculture knowledge management and delivery. In agriculture, adoption of newly developed technology is essential to enhance crop production. However, timely dissemination of authenticated agriculture information for decision making at larger scale to diversified end user has always been a challenge due to several reasons. One of the reasons is storing and delivering agriculture knowledge in machine readable form. In this paper a frame work based on semantic web is presented for collection, storing and updating of agricultural information at centralized location and delivering knowledge through intelligent decision support system through semantic web. The frame work utilizes rule based system for querying information from agriculture knowledge base. © 2018 International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

AB  - Recommender systems are needed to find food items of one's interest. This paper reviews recommender systems and recommendation methods, then propose a food personalization framework based on adaptive hypermedia and extend Hermes framework with food recommendation functionality. Moreover, it combines TF-IDF term extraction method with cosine similarity measure. Healthy heuristics and standard food database are incorporated into the knowledgebase. Based on the performed evaluation, we conclude that semantic recommender systems in general outperform traditional recommenders systems with respect to accuracy, precision, and recall, and that the proposed recommender has a better F-measure than existing semantic recommenders. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

AB  - Due to the increasing number of obese people, this paper presents a Fuzzy Markup Language (FML)-based recommender system for restaurants to infer the recommended level of a restaurant by giving the estimated calories in food, the distance to the restaurant, and the price of the served food. With the standard of the Food Exchange List (FEL), developed by The Japan Diabetes Society, and the information about the food calories, we can estimate the calories of different kinds of the food. We first construct the ontology of this system, and then we use the FML to build the knowledge base and the rule base of the recommender system based on domain experts' suggestions and Japanese persons' experience in diet. With the input of the estimated calories of food, distance of the restaurant, and price of the food, the recommended level of the restaurant is inferred to allow people to both enjoy the delicious food and make an exercise.

AB  - Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) is a problem solving methodology that reuses the knowledge of past experiences to solve new problems. It's a knowledge-based technique that has been introduced to the recommendation field to allow reasoning on domain knowledge and to generate more accurate recommendations. If CBR helps suggesting items that meet the users' search criteria, it has the disadvantage of being domain-dependent (all the reasoning process is generally based on hard-coded domain knowledge) and generating less personalized recommendations. In this paper, we propose an approach for a generic and personalized CBR-based recommender system. First, we use a generic ontology to formalize all the knowledge required during the reasoning process. The ontology represents an intermediate layer between the recommender engine and the application domain to ensure the domain-independence criteria. Second, we propose a hybridization strategy that combines CBR and collaborative filtering to alleviate the limitations of CBR and improve the personalized character of the recommendations. Finally, preliminary validation is performed using a publicly available data set of restaurants.

AB  - Background: Treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex problem. A clinical decision support system (CDSS) based on massive and distributed electronic health record data can facilitate the automation of this process and enhance its accuracy. The most important component of any CDSS is its knowledge base. This knowledge base can be formulated using ontologies. The formal description logic of ontology supports the inference of hidden knowledge. Building a complete, coherent, consistent, interoperable, and sharable ontology is a challenge. Results: This paper introduces the first version of the newly constructed Diabetes Mellitus Treatment Ontology (DMTO) as a basis for shared-semantics, domain-specific, standard, machine-readable, and interoperable knowledge relevant to T2DM treatment. It is a comprehensive ontology and provides the highest coverage and the most complete picture of coded knowledge about T2DM patients' current conditions, previous profiles, and T2DM-related aspects, including complications, symptoms, lab tests, interactions, treatment plan (TP) frameworks, and glucose-related diseases and medications. It adheres to the design principles recommended by the Open Biomedical Ontologies Foundry and is based on ontological realism that follows the principles of the Basic Formal Ontology and the Ontology for General Medical Science. DMTO is implemented under Protégé 5.0 in Web Ontology Language (OWL) 2 format and is publicly available through the National Center for Biomedical Ontology's BioPortal at http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/DMTO. The current version of DMTO includes more than 10,700 classes, 277 relations, 39,425 annotations, 214 semantic rules, and 62,974 axioms. We provide proof of concept for this approach to modeling TPs. Conclusion: The ontology is able to collect and analyze most features of T2DM as well as customize chronic TPs with the most appropriate drugs, foods, and physical exercises. DMTO is ready to be used as a knowledge base for semantically intelligent and distributed CDSS systems. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - In many agri-food companies, food quality is often managed using expertise gained through experience. Overall quality enhancement may come from sharing collective expertise. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of a complete methodology allowing an expert knowledge base to be created and used to recommend the technical action to take to maintain food quality. We present its functional specifications, defined in cooperation with several industrial partners and technical centres over the course of several projects carried out in recent years. We propose a systematic methodology for collecting the knowledge on a given food process, from the design of a questionnaire to the synthesis of the information from completed questionnaires using a mind map approach. We then propose an original core ontology for structuring knowledge as possible causal relationships between situations of interest. We describe how mind map files generated by mind map tools are automatically imported into a conceptual graph knowledge base, before being validated and finally automatically processed in a graph-based visual tool. A specific end-user interface has been designed to ensure that end-user experts in agri-food companies can use the tool in a convenient way. Finally, our approach is compared with current research. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - An ontology, a formal representation of domain knowledge, is an integral building block of the semantic web and is important in building an application within interdisciplinary domains. In the food domain, regulations require Food Business Operators (FBOs) to comply with traceability and track-ability measures when handling food in order to assess risk. In this paper, we identify several requirements to model food, food history, and risk of contamination in order to support the safety regulations of food. Using those requirements, we also identify and apply several design principles for building an ontology called prFood that encompasses interdisciplinary domains, food and risk. In order to apply safe handling of food in the food supply chain, we integrate and incorporate the pre-existing food ontologies with prFood by implementing a mapping procedure. Finally, we validate our approach by answering several use cases derived from EU and/or UK Food Regulations. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Agrifood chain processes are based on a multitude of knowledge, know-how and experiences forged over time. This collective expertise must be shared to improve food quality. Here we test the hypothesis that it is possible to design and implement a comprehensive methodology to create a knowledge base integrating collective expertise, while also using it to recommend technical actions required to improve food quality. The method used to test this hypothesis consists firstly in listing the functional specifications that were defined in collaboration with several partners (technical centers, vocational training schools, producers) over the course of several projects carried out in recent years. Secondly, we propose an innovative core ontology that utilizes the international languages of the Semantic Web to effectively represent knowledge in the form of decision trees. These decision trees will depict potential causal relationships between situations of interest and provide recommendations for managing them through technological actions, as well as a collective assessment of the efficiency of those actions. We show how mind map files created using mind-mapping tools are automatically translated into an RDF knowledge base using the core ontological model. Thirdly, a model to aggregate individual assessments provided by technicians and associated with technical action recommendations is proposed and evaluated. Finally, a multicriteria decision-support system (MCDSS) using the knowledge base is presented. It consists of an explanatory view allowing navigation in a decision tree and an action view for multicriteria filtering and possible side effect identification. The different types of MCDSS-delivered answers to a query expressed in the action view are explained. The MCDSS graphical user interface is presented through a real-use case. Experimental assessments have been performed and confirm that tested hypothesis is relevant.

TI  - A framework for evaluating agricultural ontologies
AU  - Goldstein, A.

T2  - Sustainability (Switzerland)
AB  - An ontology is a formal representation of domain knowledge, which can be interpreted by machines. In recent years, ontologies have become a major tool for domain knowledge representation and a core component of many knowledge management systems, decision-support systems and other intelligent systems, inter alia, in the context of agriculture. A review of the existing literature on agricultural ontologies, however, reveals that most of the studies, which propose agricultural ontologies, are lacking an explicit evaluation procedure. This is undesired because without well-structured evaluation processes, it is difficult to consider the value of ontologies to research and practice. Moreover, it is difficult to rely on such ontologies and share them on the Semantic Web or between semantic-aware applications. With the growing number of ontology-based agricultural systems and the increasing popularity of the Semantic Web, it becomes essential that such evaluation methods are applied during the ontology development process. Our work contributes to the literature on agricultural ontologies by presenting a framework that guides the selection of suitable evaluation methods, which seems to be missing from most existing studies on agricultural ontologies. The framework supports the matching of appropriate evaluation methods for a given ontology based on the ontology’s purpose. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Resource and energy efficiency of industrial production, in particular, food production, is a defining requirement that will ensure its functioning without loss of quality and quantity of final products. This is achieved by observing the requirements for the operational parameters of the company’s technological processes and their operational changes. Given the complexity of the functioning of the energy component of the world and Ukraine due to military operations and their consequences, the issue of quality/cost ratio has become more acute. Therefore, for large manufacturing enterprises, the development of systems for supporting management decision-making in accordance with the Industry 4.0 concept becomes relevant. This will contribute to improving the production and economic indicators of the enterprise through coordinated actions of all links of production activities by structuring and processing large amounts of heterogeneous information. The purpose of the study is to develop a decision support system for the task of choosing the structure of an automated control system based on an ontological knowledge base. The developed application ontology uses descriptive logic and is interpreted as part of a digital production double implemented by a single ontological knowledge base and ontological repository. Considering existing international standards, the OWL2 language was chosen for the implementation of the ontological knowledge base. The ontology system architecture contains an ontology server, a Node-Red application, and a user form. A project decision support system that issues recommendations based on requests for the structure of the control system for a technological facility with uncertainties, considering the requirements and restrictions set for each technological process of a food enterprise, reduces the time to choose the appropriate structures, schemes, and methods. Thus, the designer receives the necessary information, supported by knowledge from the subject area, for the synthesis of an effective automated control system. It is also assumed that the ontological system will be expanded by connecting new created applied ontologies that implement related tasks of an industrial enterprise. © 2022, National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine.

AB  - The epidemic of diabetes in American Indian (AI) communities is a serious public health challenge. The incidence and prevalence of diabetes have increased dramatically with accompanying increases in body weight and diminished physical activity. In this paper, we propose a proactive diabetes self-care recommendation system specifically for AI patients. It recommends healthy life style to users to fight for their diabetes. Thanks to the quasi-ubiquitous use of cellphones in most AI tribes, we choose cellphones as the platform to provide smart personal care for AI patients. By integrating the AI users' ontological profile with general clinical diabetes recommendation and guidelines, the system can make personalized recommendations (e.g., food intake and physical workout) based on the special socioeconomic, cultural, and geographical status particularly to AI patients. The proposed system was implemented as mobile applications. Evaluations performed by use case studies and human expert verification demonstrate the effectiveness of the system.

AB  - In the modern world, professionals of diverse industrial sectors have severely become victims of Obese and Overweight conditions. Obese and Overweight conditions can be minimized by having proper dietary plans, physical activities and minimizing alcohol-based relaxation. In this research context, we try to address the issue of having poor physical exercise. We guide professionals with suitable exercises to reduce their weight in order to have the required Body Mass Index(BMI). The user body measurements that are recommended by the domain experts to concern such as sex, height, weight, exercise preferences, age, diet details and medical history used to calculate the degree of obesity of each individual. Then the degree of obesity is mapped with the knowledge base along with the predefined rules in order to match respective exercises suitable for the particular individuals that are compatible with the user’s medical history. Two ontologies for foods and exercises were developed using Protégé 4.3.0 and were retrieved by running Simple Protocol and Resource Description Framework Query Language (SPARQL) queries. Python 3 is used as the backend language for ontology and interface integration. Frontend developed using Tkinter GUI in Python 3 and is presented for the users to ease the interaction with the system. Two ontological files of Foods and Exercises are loaded and tested for consistency using the HermiT reasoner with the aid of Owlready2. Accuracy and Correctness are checked by addressing the competency questions and by domain experts’ inspections.

T2  - IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology
AB  - In this article, we discuss existing literature on DSS in agriculture, on DSS that use data available in the Semantic Web, and on Semantic Web initiatives focusing on agriculture information. Our goal is to assess the readiness of the Semantic Web as a platform to empower DSS that can keep risk and uncertainty in agriculture under control. Key agricultural activities targeted by DSS reported in literature are nutrient management, insect and pest management, land use and planning, environmental change and forecasting, and water and drought management. The most relevant use of Semantic Web in DSS, is in data analysis, as a means of making DSS more intelligent. There are initiatives to produce vocabularies and semantic repositories in the domain of agriculture. However, data and models are still isolated in specific domain repositories, and interoperability is still weak. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2017.

AB  - E-commerce has become a major application domain for recommender systems due to its business interest. These tools aim to identify the products each user may like or find useful, which can boost users' consumption. Particularly, collaborative recommender systems rely on a set of like-minded users to select the products to offer. Taking into account the expertise of the users who drive such decision can increase the accuracy of the process. However, current approaches require extra data, that is not often available, to obtain expertise measures. In this paper, we apply a semantic approach to get a measure of practical expertise by exploiting the data available in any e-commerce recommender system-the consumption histories of the users. This way, we improve recommendation results transparently to the users.

AB  - Recommender systems aim to support their users by reducing information overload so that they can make better decisions. Recommender systems must be transparent, so users can form mental models about the system’s goals, internal state, and capabilities, that are in line with their actual design. Explanations and transparent behaviour of the system should inspire trust and, ultimately, lead to more persuasive recommendations. Here, explanations convey reasons why a recommendation is given or how the system forms its recommendations. This paper focuses on the question how such claims about effectiveness of explanations can be evaluated. Accordingly, we investigate various models that are used to assess the effects of explanations and recommendations. We discuss objective and subjective measurement and argue that both are needed. We define a set of metrics for measuring the effectiveness of explanations and recommendations. The feasibility of using these metrics is discussed in the context of a specific explainable recommender system in the food and health domain. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

T2  - 2016 International Computer Science and Engineering Conference (ICSEC)
AB  - Agriculture is one of the most significant domains in need of knowledge sharing and Decision Support Systems (DSS) that can help farmers make decisions to solve complex problems. Monoculture agriculture has many problems such as plant disease dramatically decreasing product price. Intercropping is an alternative way to reduce a risk of market price and plant disease. This research proposes three research objectives: (1) To determine the knowledge domain of intercropping planning system, (2) To develop an ontology-based knowledge prototype aimed at addressing the DSS of the planning intercropping system, and (3) To design an optimization model used for decision-making for the intercropping system. In this paper we present the ontology-based knowledge and multi-objective obtimization model to drive the decision support system for intercropping based on constraint factors from an individual farmer for illustrating maximum income and minimizing the cost for cultivating the plants.

AB  - Requirements management for globally managed large scale projects is a complex task, primarily due to the involvement of several stakeholders, multiple technologies, enormous information, and frequently changing business needs. Managing requirements communicated through mediums such as emails, chat messages, etc. is difficult due the lack of explicit context and the extensive use of unstructured information. This paper describes a requirements management framework, C-FaRM, which helps in managing requirements knowledge from multiple types of requirements artifacts. The framework makes use of custom ontology based recommender system that helps in prioritization, visualization, and negotiation of requirements.

TI  - Interdisciplinary IoT and Emotion Knowledge Graph-Based Recommendation System to Boost Mental Health
AU  - Gyrard, A.
AU  - Boudaoud, K.
T2  - Applied Sciences (Switzerland)
AB  - Humans are feeling emotions every day, but they can still encounter difficulties understanding them. To better understand emotions, we integrated interdisciplinary knowledge about emotions from various domains such as neurosciences (e.g., neurobiology), physiology, and psychology (affective sciences, positive psychology, cognitive psychology, psychophysiology, neuropsychology, etc.). To organize the knowledge, we employ technologies such as Artificial Intelligence with Knowledge Graphs and Semantic Reasoning. Furthermore, Internet of Things (IoT) technologies can help to acquire physiological data knowledge. The goal of this paper is to aggregate the interdisciplinary knowledge and implement it within the Emotional Knowledge Graph (EmoKG). The Emotional Knowledge Graph is used within our naturopathy recommender system that suggests food to boost emotion (e.g., chocolate contains magnesium that is recommended when we feel depressed). The recommender system also answers a set of competency questions to easily retrieve emotional related-knowledge from EmoKG, such as what are the basic emotions and the more sophisticated ones, what are the neurotransmitters and hormones related to emotions, etc. To follow FAIR principles, EmoKG is mapped to existing knowledge bases found on the BioPortal biomedical ontology catalog such as SNOMEDCT, FMA, RXNORM, MedDRA, and also from emotion ontologies (when available online). We design the LOV4IoT-Emotion ontology catalog that encourages researchers from heterogeneous communities to apply FAIR principles by releasing online their (emotion) ontologies, datasets, rules, etc. The set of ontology codes shared online can be semi-automatically processed; if not available, the scientific publications describing the emotion ontologies are semi-automatically processed with Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies. This research is also relevant for other use cases such as European projects (ACCRA for emotional robots to reduce the social isolation of aging people, StandICT for standardization, and AI4EU for Artificial Intelligence) and alliances for IoT such as AIOTI. The recommender system can be extended to address other advice such as aromatherapy and take into consideration medical devices to monitor patients’ vital signals related to emotions and mental health. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic disease and many people have been affected by this disease. Early diabetes prognosis can lead to improved treatment for the victims. Data mining methods are widely used to predict the disease early. This research [paper uses XAI (Explainable Artificial Intelligence). Various tools are used to determine the selection of key attributes and the integration, prediction, and mining rules of a diabetic organization. Since XAI is used, everyone can get the procedure without any problem. Here, four algorithms are utilized and in that, the best algorithm will be selected to obtain the best accuracy and provide a traumatic complement program. This paper has proposed a diabetes predictor model for better diabetes classification that includes a few external factors that cause diabetes as well as common factors such as Glucose, BMI, Age, Insulin, etc. Separation accuracy is improved with the new database compared to the extended database. If they do not have the precision of infection, healthy food will be provided to prevent diabetes.

T2  - Computers and Electronics in Agriculture
AB  - Decision support systems have become increasingly popular in the domain of agriculture. With the development of automated machine learning, agricultural experts are now able to train, evaluate and make predictions using cutting edge machine learning (ML) models without the need for much ML knowledge. Although this automated approach has led to successful results in many scenarios, in certain cases (e.g., when few labeled datasets are available) choosing among different models with similar performance metrics is a difficult task. Furthermore, these systems do not commonly allow users to incorporate their domain knowledge that could facilitate the task of model selection, and to gain insight into the prediction system for eventual decision making. To address these issues, in this paper we present AHMoSe, a visual support system that allows domain experts to better understand, diagnose and compare different regression models, primarily by enriching model-agnostic explanations with domain knowledge. To validate AHMoSe, we describe a use case scenario in the viticulture domain, grape quality prediction, where the system enables users to diagnose and select prediction models that perform better. We also discuss feedback concerning the design of the tool from both ML and viticulture experts. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

T2  - 2016 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (CIT)
AB  - Ontology has been applied in various problem domains such as health, agriculture, public administration and business management, to develop solution models for effective knowledge modelling. The models help define structures of knowledge components and their relationship among them within a problem domain that may provide better representation of a system design architecture. Such basic model of knowledge components can provide a transparent approach for enhancing design thinking and comprehension for both users and system developers. This makes the ontology technique as one of the prominent techniques for designing system solution in a context-sensitive manner. In this paper, we describe the use of ontology in two design cases for representing the problem universe of discourse. First design case is on a record management system and second case is on a decision support system. For both system design cases, the ontology technique provided benefits for gaining semantic integration and interoperability in designing the solutions. Findings from our studies suggest that ontology enables provisions both to end users and to system developers for achieving design goals that in turn maximize various user benefits.

AB  - Vegetable crop farmers diversify their production by growing a range of crops during the season on the same plot. Crop diversification and rotation enables farmers to increase their income and crop yields while enhancing their farm sustainability against climatic events and pest attacks. Farmers must plan their agricultural work per year and over successive years. Planning decisions are made on the basis of their experience regarding previous plans. For the purpose of assisting farmers in planning decisions and monitoring, we developed the Crop Planning and Production Process Ontology (C3PO), i.e., a representation of agricultural knowledge and data for diversified crop production. C3PO is composed of eight modules to capture all crop production dimensions and complexity for representing farming practices and constraints. It encodes agricultural processes and farm plot organization and captures common agricultural knowledge. C3PO introduces a representation of technical itineraries, i.e., sequences of technical farming tasks to grow vegetables, from soil identification and seed selection to harvest and storage. C3PO is the backbone of a knowledge graph which aggregates data from heterogeneous related semantic resources, e.g., organism taxonomies, chemicals, reference crop listings, or development stages. C3PO and its knowledge graph are used by the Elzeard enterprise to develop knowledge-based decision support systems for farmers. This article describes how we built C3PO and its knowledge graph—which are both publicly available—and briefly outlines their applications.

I propose an open framework as an alternative, which enables cross-domain recommendations with domain-agnostic user profiles modelled as semantic interest graphs. This novel framework covers all parts of a recommender system. It includes an architecture for privacy-enabled profile exchange, a distributed and domainagnostic user model and a cross-domain recommendation algorithm. This enables users to receive recommendations for a target domain (e.g. food) based on any kind of previous interests. Copyright © 2012 by the Association for Computing Machinery, Inc. (ACM).

AB  - Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged in recent years as a set of techniques to build systems that enable humans to understand the outcomes produced by artificial intelligent entities. Although these initiatives have advanced over the past few years, most approaches focus on explanations that are meant for literate or even skilled end users such as engineers, researchers etc. Few works available in the literature address the needs of illiterate end-users in XAI (illiterate centered design). This paper proposes a generic model to extract the contents of explanations from a given explainable AI system, and translate them into a representation format that illiterate end users may understand. The usefulness of the model is shown by reference to an application of a food recommender system. © 2023 Owner/Author.

T2  - COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
AB  - Recommender systems (RS) have been increasingly applied to food and health. However, challenges still remain, including the effective incorporation of heterogeneous information and the discovery of meaningful relationships among entities in the context of food and health recommendations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, the Health-aware Food Recommendation System with Dual Attention in Heterogeneous Graphs (HFRS-DA), for unsupervised representation learning on heterogeneous graph-structured data. HFRS-DA utilizes an attention technique to reconstruct node features and edges and employs a dual hierarchical attention mechanism for enhanced unsupervised learning of attributed graph representations. HFRS-DA addresses the challenge of effectively leveraging the heterogeneous information in the graph and discovering meaningful semantic relationships between entities. The framework analyses recipe components and their neighbours in the heterogeneous graph and can discover popular and healthy recipes, thereby promoting healthy eating habits. We compare HFRS-DA using the Allrecipes dataset and find that it outperforms all the related methods from the literature. Our study demonstrates that HFRS-DA enhances the unsupervised learning of attributed graph representations, which is important in scenarios where labelled data is scarce or unavailable. HFRS-DA can generate node embeddings for unused data effectively, enabling both inductive and transductive learning.

AB  - Along with the massive influence of computational technologies in medical research and practice, the wide generation of patient, clinical and lab tests data make the assistance of intelligent information systems very important for correct therapy, surveillance and advising of the patient. Medical data is highly heterogeneous and with different structure and formats. Principal tasks of the work are focused at intelligent integration of all data related to a particular patient. Aside with the methodological aspects of linking medical data, an important part of the discussed study focuses on the design and development of a special purpose decision support system. This system enriches a specific ontology for diabetes mellitus with a set of newly defined rules, supporting the development of broad and more precise personalized dietary recommendations as a part of digitized healthcare assistance.

T2  - INFORMATION
AB  - This paper focuses on recommender system for agriculture in Mali called SyrAgri. The goal is to guide and improve the quality-of-experience of farmers by offering them good farming practices according to their needs. Two types of recommendations are essentially taken into account: the recommendation of crops and the recommendation of farming practices based on some predefined criteria which are: yield, life cycle of the crop, type of soil, growing season, etc. SyrAgri also informs farmers about crop rotation and the similarity between different types of crops based on the following parameters: crop families, growing seasons and appropriate soil types. For the development of this system a hybrid recommendation approach was used: demographic, semantic and collaborative methods. Each method is adapted to a specific stage of a user's visit to the system. The demographic approach is first activated in order to offer recommendations to new users of the system, which resolves the concept of cold start (immediate inclusion of a new item or a new user in the system). The semantic approach is then activated to recommend to the user items (crops, agricultural practices) semantically close to those (s)he has appreciated. Finally, the collaborative approach is used to recommend items that similar users have liked.

AB  - Biofeedback sensors for health monitoring are rapidly growing in terms of ubiquity and cost. They enable remote, accurate, and low-cost health monitoring and can provide personalized health monitoring and care with timely detection of health issues, especially for children. In this paper, we propose a novel system for real-time personalized health advisory system for children in order to promote healthy habits and activities (including food, clothing, and activities). The system utilizes Electronic Child Record (ECR) that is continuously updated according to the captured measurements from biofeedback devices, and ontologies for vitamins/allergies, to provide personalized semantic-based recommendations. The preliminary evaluation demonstrated the potential of the proposed system to promote well being of children and facilitate the communication among parties involved in the children care (parents, school staff, and health care staff).

This research addresses this imperative by introducing an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) framework to estimate obesity levels. Meticulous hyperparameter tuning has resulted in elevated performance metrics, including accuracy, weighted precision, weighted recall, and weighted F1-score. Leveraging a decision support system, a robust machine learning model is developed exhibiting an impressive cross-validation accuracy of 97.39%. The model seamlessly integrates data on eating habits and physical condition, demonstrating improved performance in estimating obesity levels. The application of SHAP analysis unveils critical features within the dataset, thereby augmenting model interpretability and trustworthiness. The outcomes of this study provide a reliable tool for physicians, contributing to more informed clinical decisions in obesity management.

TI  - An ontology model to represent aquaponics 4.0 system's knowledge
AU  - Abbasi, R
AU  - Martinez, P
AU  - Ahmad, R
T2  - INFORMATION PROCESSING IN AGRICULTURE
AB  - Aquaponics, one of the vertical farming methods, is a combination of aquaculture and hydroponics. To enhance the production capabilities of the aquaponics system and maximize crop yield on a commercial level, integration of Industry 4.0 technologies is needed. Industry 4.0 is a strategic initiative characterized by the fusion of emerging technologies such as big data and analytics, internet of things, robotics, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. The realization of aquaponics 4.0, however, requires an efficient flow and integration of data due to the presence of complex biological processes. A key challenge in this essence is to deal with the semantic heterogeneity of multiple data resources. An ontology that is regarded as one of the normative tools solves the semantic interoperation problem by describing, extracting, and sharing the domains' knowledge. In the field of agriculture, several ontologies are developed for the soil-based farming methods, but so far, no attempt has been made to represent the knowledge of the aquaponics 4.0 system in the form of an ontology model. Therefore, this study proposes a unified ontology model, AquaONT, to rep-resent and store the essential knowledge of an aquaponics 4.0 system. This ontology pro-vides a mechanism for sharing and reusing the aquaponics 4.0 system's knowledge to solve the semantic interoperation problem. AquaONT is built from indoor vertical farming terminologies and is validated and implemented by considering experimental test cases related to environmental parameters, design configuration, and product quality. The proposed ontology model will help vertical farm practitioners with more transparent decision -making regarding crop production, product quality, and facility layout of the aquaponics farm. For future work, a decision support system will be developed using this ontology model and artificial intelligence techniques for autonomous data-driven decisions.(c) 2021 China Agricultural University.

AB  - Recommender system in information retrieval systems recommends relevant items to consumers by inspecting the consumer's preferences and objective behaviours. We received recommendations daily regarding what to take in as food, buy, and choices about the wear trends. However, we can understand our recommendations, and even less, we can tune our preferences efficiently. One main concern is those undesired or irrelevant recommendations, not only wasting our time, but they also cost media companies millions of dollars every year. Considering this issue, we proposed a tunable and explainable recommendation system where the attributes that determined the recommendations are explainable and tunable for every individual consumer. Irrelevant recommendations waste the consumer's time and the company's money, but if we put the power of the recommendations in the consumer's hands, we have a win-win situation. The suggested method addresses recommendation algorithms issues, which creates negative feedback loops and allows consumers to be aware of the profile they are building and tune it to see the content that interests them most.

TI  - Ontology-based Daily Menu Recommendation System for Complementary Food According to Nutritional Needs using Naïve Bayes and TOPSIS
AU  - Showafah, M.

T2  - International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications
AB  - Babies begin to be given complementary feeding at the age of 6 to 24 months. Complementary foods given to babies need to meet nutritional needs according to their ages. Since, at these ages, babies are just learning to eat, it is necessary to plan a complementary food menu referring to the nutritional needs and the baby and mother's preferences. It is certainly not an easy thing for a mother. Therefore, a recommendation system is needed to determine the baby's daily menu according to those all. This research proposes a complementary food menu recommendation system that considers the balanced composition of three significant nutrients (carbohydrates, protein, and fat) in the diet. It also takes into account the baby and mother's preferences. The ontology contains Knowledge-based about food and its nutritional content and the nutritional needs of babies according to their ages. Naive Bayes is used to prepare menu options according to user preferences. TOPSIS method is used in this study to provide optimal recommendations regarding nutritional balance and user preferences. Several mothers who have had babies aged 6-24 months and mothers of babies aged 624 months were asked to test the recommendation system. The results of the usability testing of the system using SUS showed a good level of user satisfaction. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Smart agriculture has emerged as a rich application domain for AI-driven decision support systems (DSS) that support sustainable and responsible agriculture, by improving resource-utilization through better on-farm, management decisions. However, smart agriculture’s promise is often challenged by the high barriers to user adoption. This paper develops a case-based reasoning (CBR) system called PBI-CBR to predict grass growth for dairy farmers, that combines predictive accuracy and explanation capabilities designed to improve user adoption. The system provides post-hoc, personalized explanation-by-example for its predictions, by using explanatory cases from the same farm or county. A key novelty of PBI-CBR is its use of Bayesian methods for case exclusion in this regression domain. Experiments report the tradeoff that occurs between predictive accuracy and explanatory adequacy for different parametric variants of PBI-CBR, and how updating Bayesian priors each year reduces error. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The highest challenge humankind is facing in the current time period is the enormous population growth and the need to meet the food and nutrient to the population. To meet the enormous production, the farmers are more relayed on the usage of chemicals to increase the food production during the cultivation process. Inclination towards chemical fertilizers is because of their popularity and availability, the over usage of these chemicals is a root cause of many major problems like nutrient-less crops, soil quality degradation, and environmental hazards in the long run. The availability of a knowledge base of the soil quality parameters and their related organic fertilizers according to the farmer's region can decrease the inclination towards the utilization of chemical fertilizers and adopt the usage of organic fertilizers. To help in this process of a major change in farming we built an ontology oriented deep learning model which recommends the farmers in choosing the best organic fertilizers based on the soil quality. The domain ontology construction for agriculture is based on semantic language which can be reused in the future. The knowledge base is then utilized by the deep learning model to process the data and recommend the best suitable fertilizers. © 2023 International Information and Engineering Technology Association.

AB  - Mobile devices are used extensively by the people for communication, music, entertainment, Internet and social networking. There is a lack of applications, which can be really useful for the professionals to improve their working capabilities. Though mobile phones are used by people living in rural areas, but there are hardly any relevant applications for them to improve their productivity. In this paper, we have proposed and implemented an information system for farmers which can be operated on their mobile phones. The system is developed using Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) to process spatial data and knowledge base. The knowledge base is maintained in the form of ontologies. The system is an effort to fill the gap between farmers and agricultural experts. A farmer can provide inputs related to crops being cultivated and location specific information to get specific suggestions, alerts and recommendations to improve productivity. It will be generated using the knowledge base. Whenever a farmer observes some anomalous behavior for crops or climate, the system is able to generate recommendations based on inputs provided. We have resolved some of the queries as a part of on-going work and results are displayed on an Android based mobile devices for demonstration of the system.

AB  - A traceability tool is an asset to the supply chain, especially the food one. The supply chain involves various sources of data, which is essential for effective traceability. Hence, a traceability system should overcome the heterogeneous data integration issue. Therefore, this paper introduces an ontology that formalizes the traceability tasks and surroundings elements to exchange information. Thus, this article describes the main features of an Intelligent Traceability Ontology (ITO). This ontology represents the main relationships between traceability activities and the entities involved in these activities. Moreover, this modeling can be used not only for tracing and tracking product information but also for supervising the product's environment parameters.

T2  - Neural Computing and Applications
AB  - Crop Recommendation Systems are invaluable tools for farmers, assisting them in making informed decisions about crop selection to optimize yields. These systems leverage a wealth of data, including soil characteristics, historical crop performance, and prevailing weather patterns, to provide personalized recommendations. In response to the growing demand for transparency and interpretability in agricultural decision-making, this study introduces XAI-CROP an innovative algorithm that harnesses eXplainable artificial intelligence (XAI) principles. The fundamental objective of XAI-CROP is to empower farmers with comprehensible insights into the recommendation process, surpassing the opaque nature of conventional machine learning models. The study rigorously compares XAI-CROP with prominent machine learning models, including Gradient Boosting (GB), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB), and Multimodal Naïve Bayes (MNB). Performance evaluation employs three essential metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R2). The empirical results unequivocally establish the superior performance of XAI-CROP. It achieves an impressively low MSE of 0.9412, indicating highly accurate crop yield predictions. Moreover, with an MAE of 0.9874, XAI-CROP consistently maintains errors below the critical threshold of 1, reinforcing its reliability. The robust R2 value of 0.94152 underscores XAI-CROP's ability to explain 94.15% of the data's variability, highlighting its interpretability and explanatory power. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is characterized by insulin deficiency and blood sugar control issues. The state-of-the-art solution is the artificial pancreas (AP), which integrates basal insulin delivery and glucose monitoring. However, APs are unable to manage postprandial glucose response (PGR) due to limited knowledge of its determinants, requiring additional information for accurate bolus delivery, such as estimated carbohydrate intake. This study aims to quantify the influence of various meal-related factors on predicting postprandial blood glucose levels (BGLs) at different time intervals (15 min, 60 min, and 120 min) after meals by using deep neural network (DNN) models. The prediction models incorporate preprandial blood glucose values, insulin dosage, and various meal-related nutritional factors such as intake of energy, carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, fatty acids, fibers, glycemic index, and glycemic load as input variables. The impact of input features was assessed by exploiting eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methodologies, specifically SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), which provide insights into each feature's contribution to the model predictions. By leveraging XAI methodologies, this study aims to enhance the interpretability and transparency of BGL prediction models and validate clinical literature hypotheses. The findings can aid in the development of decision-support tools for individuals with T1DM, facilitating PGR management and reducing the risks of adverse events. The improved understanding of PGR determinants may lead to advancements in AP technology and improve the overall quality of life for T1DM patients.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Purpose – In difficult geographical zones (mountain, intra-cities areas, etc.), many shippers, from small and medium enterprises to individuals, may demand delivery of different food products (fresh, refrigerated, frozen, etc.) in small quantities. On the other side, carrier companies wish to use their vehicles optimally. Taking into account the perishability constraints (short-shelflife, temperature limits, etc.) of the transported food products and environmental constraints (pollution, carbon impact) while consolidating multiple kinds of food products to use vehicles optimally is not achieved by current transportation planning solutions. The purpose of this paper is to present an interoperable solution of a marketplace, formed by shippers and carriers, dedicated to the schedule of food transport orders. Design/methodology/approach – This transportation planning system named Interoperable-Pathfinder, Order, Vehicle, Environment and Supervisor (I-POVES) is an interoperable multi-agent system, based on the SCEP (supervisor, customer, environment and producer) model (Archimede and Coudert, 2001). Ontologies are developed to create the planning marketplace comprising demands and offers from different sources (multiple shippers and carriers). Findings – A hierarchy ontology for food products. A transporter system ontology. A global ontology that contains all shared concepts used by local ontologies of both shippers and carriers. I-POVES an interoperable model, which facilitates collaboration between carriers and their shippers through its active agents. Practical implications – I-POVES is tested on a case study from the TECCAS Poctefa project, comprising transport and food companies from both sides of the Pyrenees (France and Spain). Originality/value – There has been much work in the literature on the delivery of products, but very few on the delivery of food products. Work related to delivery of food products focuses mostly on timely delivery for avoiding its wastage. In this paper, constraints related to food products and to environment (pollution and carbon impact) of transport resources are taken into account while planning the delivery. © Muhammad Ali Memon, Mohamed Hedi Karray, Agnès Letouzey and Bernard Archimède.

AB  - Orchid is one of the economic crops in world market. The varieties of shape, style, color and smell of orchids attract people to create products in many ways, such as cut orchid, orchid plant, bouquet, lei, corsage, and orchid loose bloom and so on. Thailand is one of the biggest exporters in orchid market. There are a lot of processes in the chain, such as reproduction, cultivation, market trend survey and analysis, transportation, international trade standard, traceability and so on. In order to provide a smart knowledge service, we have to 1) managing knowledge efficiently in terms of sharing and reusing knowledge and 2) providing knowledge which matches to stakeholders. In this paper, we propose a general framework on ontology base orchid cluster platform for developing a user-centric model of knowledge services in orchid cluster. We give some examples on semantic search model, recommended system model and tracking and monitoring model respectively.

AB  - Aquaculture is a growing industry. It would be beneficial to the fish farmers if the data about the fish, such as the ecosystem, food and related information are available to them to increase the fish yield. Most of the fish species data of the aquaculture domain are stored using relational databases. However, the relational tables work well only for structured data. It would help the fishermen if the data can be visualized and provided with a suitable recommendation system that recommends the best species and best ecosystem. In this paper, an approach to store the details of fish species of the brackish water of the west coast of Karnataka, India using Neo4j is presented. Further, a recommendation system to retrieve the best fish species for a particular ecosystem is proposed. The data relating to fish species, names, threatened status, taxonomy, fish species location, type of water they survive in are stored as a connected graph in the Neo4j graph database. This helps the aquatic scientists and aquaculture users visualize the relationship among the fish species and get suitable recommendations on fish species based on their interests. The proposed system is scalable and is capable of processing any complex relationship for providing recommendations.

AB  - Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are one of nature's responses to nutrient enrichment in aquatic systems and increasingly occur in coastal waters, such as in Lampung Bay and Jakarta Bay, Indonesia. HABs present environmental and fisheries management challenges due to their unpredictability, spatial coverage, and detrimental health effects on coastal organisms, including humans. Here, an automated algae species identification system assisted and validated by expert judgment was proposed. The system used ontology as guidance to determine the species of algae and certainty factors to indicate the level of confidence of the experts when providing a statement or judgment for a particular object or event under consideration. The system was tested to identify 60 samples using 51 predetermined algal characteristics. The tests were narrowed down to the 20 most common HAB-causing algae types found in the study sites and compared with identification by experts. The results showed that the system successfully identified the test data with an accuracy of 73.33%. The system also had a high agreement (above 79.75%) with the identification performed by experts on six algae species. Further improvement of the system's accuracy could facilitate its use as an alternative tool in rapid algal identification or part of an early warning system for HABs.

T2  - 2023 IEEE 13th Symposium on Computer Applications & Industrial Electronics (ISCAIE)
AB  - A quality-oriented melon selection process is an important factor in increasing consumers willingness to pay. However, unlike most fruits, melons are usually sold whole, making it difficult to choose a perfectly ripe and sweet melon, as skin color and texture play an important role in this. From a marketing perspective, the selling power of melons is influenced by demand and supply. This paper presents a new approach by utilizing hidden semantic data on melon images derived from digital images. Semantic information on the surface of the melon is described, extracted, and shared as domain knowledge using an ontology approach that allows the relationship between parameters to produce descriptions and actions in determining the quality of the melon. Using K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to model the data that has been obtained from the visual data extraction process An information description approach using an ontology guided by KNN in determining the quality of the proposed melons can assist farmers in classifying quality melons at reasonable prices with limited human involvement.

TI  - A Methodological Approach for Development and Deployment of Data Sharing in Complex Organizational Supply and Logistics Networks with Blockchain Technology
AU  - Hofman, W.J.
T2  - IFAC-PapersOnLine
AB  - Each manufacturer, supplier, and retailer has its own chain of collaborating stakeholders to meet their customer demands. Many perspectives can be taken like food safety, security, and sustainability, which may each lead to separate solutions that are not necessarily interoperable with each other. Data can only be shared within the context of those solutions and only with extra effort, and thus costs, across these solutions. To address this solution, this paper proposes a methodological approach for specification of data that can be shared with rapid deployment by for instance a blockchain based - or a peer-to-peer infrastructure. The methodological approach is based on basic informatics principles like the Turing machine and ontologies. © 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Online Food Ordering Service (OFOS) is a popular location-based service that helps people order what they want. Compared with traditional e-commerce recommendation systems, users’ interests may be diverse under different spatiotemporal contexts, leading to various spatiotemporal data distributions, which increases the difficulty of model learning. However, numerous current works simply mix all samples to train a set of model parameters, which makes it challenging to capture the diversity in different spatiotemporal contexts. Therefore, we address this challenge by proposing a Bottom-up Adaptive Spatiotemporal Model(BASM) to adaptively fit the spatiotemporal data distribution, further improving the fitting capability of the model. Specifically, a spatiotemporal-aware embedding layer performs weight adaptation on field granularity in feature embedding to achieve the purpose of dynamically perceiving spatiotemporal contexts. Meanwhile, we propose a spatiotemporal semantic transformation layer to explicitly convert the concatenated input of the raw semantic to the spatiotemporal semantic, which can further enhance the semantic representation under different spatiotemporal contexts. Furthermore, we introduce a novel spatiotemporal adaptive bias tower to capture diverse spatiotemporal bias, reducing the difficulty of modeling spatiotemporal distinction. To further verify the effectiveness of BASM, we propose two new metrics, Time-period-wise AUC (TAUC) and City-wise AUC (CAUC). Extensive offline evaluations on public and industrial datasets are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model. The online A/B experiment also further illustrates the practicability of the model online service. This proposed method has now been implemented on Ele.me, a major online food ordering platform in China, serving more than 100 million online users.

AB  - Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic disease and many people have been affected by this disease. Early diabetes prognosis can lead to improved treatment for the victims. Data mining methods are widely used to predict the disease early. This research [paper uses XAI (Explainable Artificial Intelligence). Various tools are used to determine the selection of key attributes and the integration, prediction, and mining rules of a diabetic organization. Since XAI is used, everyone can get the procedure without any problem. Here, four algorithms are utilized and in that, the best algorithm will be selected to obtain the best accuracy and provide a traumatic complement program. This paper has proposed a diabetes predictor model for better diabetes classification that includes a few external factors that cause diabetes as well as common factors such as Glucose, BMI, Age, Insulin, etc. Separation accuracy is improved with the new database compared to the extended database. If they do not have the precision of infection, healthy food will be provided to prevent diabetes.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - User experience (UX) analysis of Online Food Delivery Services (OFDS) involves features like order placement efficacy, delivery tracking reliability, ease of navigation, menu visibility, and payment process simplicity. By examining these factors, OFDS offers can optimize its platforms to improve user satisfaction, streamline ordering procedures, minimize friction points, and improve customer retention. We can gain valued visions into customer opinions and preferences by connecting sentiment analysis, recommendation systems, feature extractors, and XAI platforms. Then, this information can be employed to develop the superiority of service, personalize UX, and finally develop customer fulfilment and platform victory. This paper presents a Reptile Search Algorithm with a Hybrid DL-based UX Detection (RSAHDL-UXD) approach on OFDSs. The RSAHDL-UXD approach utilizes data preprocessing and a word2vec-based word embedding process. For UX recognition, sliced multi-head self-attention slice recurrent neural network (SMH-SASRNN) methodology is employed. Finally, the hyperparameter tuning procedure was executed using RSA. To validate the upgraded performance of the RSAHDL-UXD methodology, a wide array of models was executed on manifold online food services datasets. The experimental outcomes stated that the RSAHDL-UXD model highlighted the superior accuracy of 98.57% and 93.33% on the Swiggy and Zomato datasets, respectively.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The awareness about healthy lifestyles is increasing, opening to personalized intelligent health coaching applications. A demand for more than mere suggestions and mechanistic interactions has driven attention to nutrition virtual coaching systems (NVC) as a bridge between human–machine interaction and recommender, informative, persuasive, and argumentation systems. NVC can rely on data-driven opaque mechanisms. Therefore, it is crucial to enable NVC to explain their doing (i.e., engaging the user in discussions (via arguments) about dietary solutions/alternatives). By doing so, transparency, user acceptance, and engagement are expected to be boosted. This study focuses on NVC agents generating personalized food recommendations based on user-specific factors such as allergies, eating habits, lifestyles, and ingredient preferences. In particular, we propose a user-agent negotiation process entailing run-time feedback mechanisms to react to both recommendations and related explanations. Lastly, the study presents the findings obtained by the experiments conducted with multi-background participants to evaluate the acceptability and effectiveness of the proposed system. The results indicate that most participants value the opportunity to provide feedback and receive explanations for recommendations. Additionally, the users are fond of receiving information tailored to their needs. Furthermore, our interactive recommendation system performed better than the corresponding traditional recommendation system in terms of effectiveness regarding the number of agreements and rounds. © 2024, The Author(s).

AB  - Recipe is a set of instructions that describes how to make food. It can help people from the preparation of ingredients, food cooking process, etc. to prepare the food, and increasingly in demand on the Web. To help users find the vast amount of recipes on the Web, we address the task of recipe recommendation. Due to multiple data types and relationships in a recipe, we can treat it as a heterogeneous network to describe its information more accurately. To effectively utilize the heterogeneous network, metapath was proposed to describe the higher-level semantic information between two entities by defining a compound path from peer entities. Therefore, we propose a metapath-enhanced recipe recommendation framework, RecipeMeta, that combines GNN (Graph Neural Network)-based representation learning and specific metapath-based information in a recipe to predict User-Recipe pairs for recommendation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed model, RecipeMeta, outperforms state-of-the-art methods for recipe recommendation. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Today, exploiting sentiment analysis has become popular in designing recommender systems in various fields, including the restaurant and food area. However, most of the sentiment analysis -based restaurant recommender systems only use static information such as food quality, price, and service quality. The analysis of users' opinions and the extraction of their food preferences lead to the provision of personalized recommendations, which is a research gap in literature; In this paper, a context -aware recommender system is proposed that extracts the food preferences of individuals from their comments and suggests restaurants in accordance with these preferences. For this purpose, the semantic approach is used to cluster the name of foods extracted from users' comments and analyze their sentiments about them. Finally, nearby open restaurants are recommended based on their similarity to user preferences. For evaluation, the TripAdvisor website has been used and comments from 100 different users have been collected during the first 9 months of 2018. The precision, recall and f -measure of the system are measured in three scenarios of top1, top3, and top5. The results indicate that the proposed system can provide recommendations with a precision of 92.8%, giving users a high degree of precision. Besides, the system outperforms the previous research in these criteria.

AB  - Recommender system is an effective way to help users to obtain the personalized and useful information. However, due to complexity and dynamic, the traditional recommender system cannot work well in mobile environment. In this paper, we propose a restaurant recommender system in mobile environment. This recommender system adopts a user preference model by using the features of user's visited restaurants, and also utilizes the location information of user and restaurants to dynamically generate the recommendation results. Baidu map cloud service is used to implement the proposed recommender system. The result of a case study shows that the proposed restaurant recommender system can effectively utilize user's preference and the location information to recommend the personalized and suitable restaurants for different users.

TI  - Ontology-Based Decision Support System for the Nitrogen Fertilization of Winter Wheat

T2  - Communications in Computer and Information Science
AB  - Digital technologies are already used in several aspects of agriculture. However, decision-making in crop production is still often a manual process that relies on various heterogeneous data sources. Small-scale farmers and their local consultants are particularly burdened by increasingly complex requirements. Regional circumstances and regulations play an essential role and need to be considered. This paper presents an ontology-based decision support system for the nitrogen fertilization of winter wheat in Bavaria, Germany. Semantic Web and Linked Data technologies were employed to both reuse and model new common semantic structures for interrelated knowledge. Many relevant general and regional data sources from multiple domains were not yet available in RDF. Hence, we used several tools to transform relevant data into corresponding OWL ontologies and combined them in a central knowledge base. The GUI application of the decision support system queries it to parameterize requests to external web services and to show relevant information in an integrated view. It further uses SPARQL queries to automatically generate recommendations for farmers and their consultants. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Ontology Based Agriculture Data Mining using IWO and RNN
AU  - Saraswat, Deepak
T2  - 2023 6th International Conference on Information Systems and Computer Networks (ISCON)
AB  - An ontology is a machine-interpretable formal description of domain knowledge. In current years, ontologies have risen to prominence as a key tool for demonstrating domain knowledge and a key element of several knowledge management systems, decision-support systems (DSS) and other intelligent systems including in agriculture. However, a study of the current literature on agricultural ontologies suggests that the majority of research that suggest agricultural ontologies lack a clear assessment mechanism. This is unwanted because this is impossible to assess the value of ontologies in research and practise without well-structured assessment mechanisms. Furthermore, relying on such ontologies and sharing them on the Semantic Web or amongst semantic-aware apps is problematic. This paper presents a framework for selecting appropriate assessment techniques for Ontology Based Agriculture Data Mining utilizing Invasive Weed Optimization (IWO) and Re-current Neural Network (RNN) that appears to be absent from most recent agricultural ontology research. The framework facilitates the selection of relevant evaluation techniques for a particular ontology based on its intended user.

TI  - SSDB-Net: A Single-Step Dual Branch Network for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation of Food Images
AU  - Cai, Q.

T2  - 2023 IEEE 25th International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing, MMSP 2023
AB  - Food image segmentation, as a critical task in food and nutrition research, promotes the development of various application domains such as calorie and nutrition estimation, food recommender systems, and daily food monitoring systems. Currently, most of the research is focused on food and non-food segmentation, which simply segments the food and background regions. Differently, semantic food segmentation can identify different specific food ingredients in a food image and provide more detailed and accurate information such as object location, shape and class. This is a more challenging but meaningful task, because the same food may appear in completely different colours, shapes and textures in different dishes, and correspondingly less researched. From the implementation perspective, most previous research is based on deep learning methods with pixel-level labelled data. However, annotating pixel-level labels requires extremely high labour costs. In this paper, a novel single-step dual branch network (SSDB-Net) is proposed to achieve weakly supervised semantic food segmentation. To our knowledge, this research is the first time proposing weakly supervised semantic food segmentation with image-level labels based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). It may serve as a benchmark for future food segmentation research. Our proposal method resulted in an mIoU of 14.79% for 104 categories in the FoodSeg103 dataset compared to 11.49% of the state-of-the-art WSSS method applied in food domains. © 2023 IEEE.

TI  - Towards a Usable Ontology: The Identification of Quality Characteristics for an Ontology-Driven Decision Support System
AU  - Wilson, S.I.

T2  - IEEE Access
AB  - Achieving quality in use (i.e., the higher-level quality objectives) is now widely accepted for building a usable system and software product. However, ontology engineering is a discipline for which the quality theories are not yet well developed and adapted and thus, ontology engineering still does not have an agreed methodology and standards for ontology evaluation. As a result, an ontology-driven system may consist of a badly engineered ontology that is not usable. This will in turn cause an adverse effect on the quality in use of the corresponding system. It is necessary to alleviate this problem by formulating an evaluation methodology and standards towards producing a usable ontology particularly targeting an ontology-driven system. It is evident through the literature as well as our practical experience through an agricultural ontology-driven Decision Support System (DSS) that quality in use of the system is tightly coupled with the quality of the ontology. As the first step towards this, we explored the well-established quality theories in system and software engineering to adapt and enhance the quality concepts defined so far in the ontology engineering domain. In the light of this study, we devised an ontology quality approach that guides developers to produce ontologies by avoiding quality issues to make ontology-driven DSSs usable. The proposed approach was exemplified using a use case from the agriculture domain. This research could be a foundation to inspire and assist ontology engineers to rethink about ontology quality from a broader view in developing a usable ontology.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - About 35% of India's Gross National Product comes through agricultural sector. Any losses in gross agricultural product also affect Indian economy. Percentage of crop yield loss due to pests and dieses is considerable. As grapes are grown in most of states in India, it plays important role in gross crop yield. Having a computerized system for managing pests and disease occurring in grapes will help in increasing total yield of grapes. The paper proposes expert system for pest and disease management of grapes where we provide forecasting of probable pests and diseases. This work considers current weather conditions at grape farm location for forecasting. Knowledge base for pests and disease is generated by extracting information from internet and storing it as OWL document. Inference engine for grape expert system is based on fuzzy logic as weather conditions can logically be represented as fuzzy variables. It uses rule base developed by experts.

AB  - When using Artificial Intelligence techniques for Knowledge management in decision support systems, the enhancement of knowledge should be based both on artificial machine learning methods and a natural human learning approach. Indeed, knowledge representation with ontologies and Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) is not enough for gaining qualitative results in decision support systems. We need to manage know-how, i.e. living knowledge. For example, enhancing biodiversity and music means teaching and learning the effectiveness of individual and living interpretations (how to observe a natural specimen, how to play a music sheet). The quality of descriptions is thus very important to correctly classify or identify marine or terrestrial organisms, or learn adequately an instrument such as the guitar or the piano. This paper introduces Sign management to tackle this qualitative learning problem in AI. Then, a Co-design methodology and a cooking method on a Creativity Platform are proposed: when dealing with such complex domains, we need to focus on the signification of knowledge construction that operates in co-designing an e-service that should be useful for reaching a more robust knowledge base. Our finding is that due to different interpretations of domain objects from subjects (persons), we need sign bases to move from written expert knowledge transmission to multimedia knowhow sharing in the community for getting better results. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2016.

AB  - There has been an unfortunate increase in gastronomy-related diseases especially due to today's urban living style with less physical activity and unhealthy nutrition. Obesity and diabetes have become climbing threats to human life more than ever before. Besides, combating with diabetes and obesity leads serious economic bottlenecks. Aligned with such a socio-economic state-of-play, technology-enhanced solutions are coming to forward. However, there is still a big need to develop holistic solutions considering the entire food value chain where food and health stakeholders meet in consensus. This paper presents an innovative reflection of this holistic approach with specific interest on two aspects: (1) Combat with diabetes and (2) Food, but especially dessert, design and production processes; considering patient's or eater's preferences and health constraints cordially for better personalized medicine and nutrition. The proposed case study presents an integrated solution that is composed of a combined food, diabetes and dessert design ontology for more comprehensive and structured data analysis, IoT-enabled diabetes monitoring, VR-enabled dessert design and production for better cognitive enjoyment and participative virtual market for diversified access to food stakeholders.

T2  - 2015 2nd International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development (INDIACom)
AB  - Web has seen a tremendous growth in its size in recent years. It has become a very tedious task to find the relevant information from Web search engines. Agriculture plays an important role in the economy of our country. Farmers, producers, supply-chain managers, extension workers, researchers and academicians are some of the important stakeholders in the field of agriculture. Web has now become an important medium for dissemination of information required by all of these. But, the retrieval of desired information from Web is a difficult task as it requires sifting through all the search results and identifying correct Web pages. A solution to this problem is personalization of search results according to user interests and preferences. Further, semantic Web and multi-agent technology is playing an important role in adding the meaning to the Web contents. At present, very little efforts have seen in applying personalization using semantic Web and agent technology in the area of agriculture. This research proposes a framework based on semantic Web and agent technology for the retrieval of personalized information from Web in agriculture domain. This would help stakeholders in accessing the required information easily and efficiently through agents.

TI  - Preference Learning in Food Recommendation: the "Myfood" Case Study
AU  - S. Sandri
AU  - A. Molinari
T2  - 2023 3rd International Conference on Electrical, Computer, Communications and Mechatronics Engineering (ICECCME)
AB  - This paper introduces MyFood, a software platform that utilizes semantic technologies and artificial intelligence to represent knowledge in the food domain and to provide smart services to its users. The platform leverages big data for large volume analysis, providing innovative, high-value services for all players in the food chain. MyFood’s design began with creating a comprehensive ontology covering food components, enabling restaurateurs and customers to consult a complete, detailed menu in compliance with the law. The platform also supports people searching for specific food services based on ingredients, verifying compatibility with ethical, religious, or food-related allergies or intolerances. MyFood’s knowledge graph allows for "intelligent" operations that increase its value for various users. This paper presents a sub-component of the MyFood platform that utilizes preference neural nets (PNN) to provide recommendations to end users based on their profile of needs related to the ingredients of the dishes. The PNN suggests the most suitable restaurant(s) for the user based on their needs. This paper provides an overview of the PNN-based recommendation system and its implementation within the MyFood platform. Overall, the MyFood platform’s preference learning component has the potential to enhance the user experience by providing tailored recommendations that match their preferences and dietary restrictions. We present insights into the early implementation and design of MyFood, highlighting its potential to transform the food industry through its cutting-edge technology and innovative services.

This research addresses these issues by emphasizing user profiling techniques. This article proposes an innovative user profile updating technique that explores the key components of user profile (basic information, behavior, and domain knowledge). An enhanced kernel fuzzy mean clustering algorithm constructs a dynamic user portrait based on domain knowledge mapping. This dynamic portrait is combined with e-commerce personalized recommendation to improve the accuracy of inferring user interests, thus facilitating accurate recommendation on the platform. The method proposed in this article greatly improves the overall performance and provides strong support for developing smarter and more personalized e-commerce product recommendation systems.

T2  - EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB  - The Internet has revolutionised the way information is retrieved, and the increase in the number of users has resulted in a surge in the volume and heterogeneity of available data. Recommender systems have become popular tools to help users retrieve relevant information quickly. Food Recommender Systems (FRS), in particular, have proven useful in overcoming the overload of information present in the food domain. However, the recommendation of food is a complex domain with specific characteristics causing many challenges. Additionally, very few systematic literature reviews have been conducted in the domain on FRS. This paper presents a systematic literature review that summarises the current state-of-the-art in FRS. Our systematic review examines the different methods and algorithms used for recommendation, the data and how it is processed, and evaluation methods. It also presents the advantages and disadvantages of FRS. To achieve this, a total of 67 high-quality studies were selected from a pool of 2,738 studies using strict quality criteria. The review reveals that the domain of food recommendation is very diverse, and most FRS are built using content-based filtering and ML approaches to provide non-personalised recommendations. The review provides valuable information to the research field, helping researchers in the domain to select a strategy to develop FRS. This review can help improve the efficiency of development, thus closing the gap between the development of FRS and other recommender systems.

TI  - A Cloud-Based Framework for Agricultural Data Integration: A Top-Down-Bottom-Up Approach
AU  - A. Goldstein

T2  - IEEE Access
AB  - In recent years, growing use of information technology (IT) and the big data revolution in agriculture have led many farms to adopt precision agriculture methods and to accumulate large amounts of data. Exploiting these data for effective decision support requires the ability to integrate data from various sources, to conveniently analyze the data, and to infer valuable insights. This paper presents a framework for integrating and analyzing agricultural data from various sources, which leverages cloud-computing, thereby contributing to the scalability, flexibility, affordability, and maintainability of the solution compared to existing solutions. The framework defines a functional infrastructure of cloud-based services that facilitate integration, analysis, and data visualization. These services can be either end-user applications or services intended as a platform for creating new services. To design the framework’s architecture, we applied a top-down and bottom-up approach. Based on the top-down analysis of information collected through interviews, questionnaires, and literature review, we defined an initial architecture of the framework. We then used this initial architecture to develop different applications, and based on the experience and insights gained and new requirements that were faced, the architecture was revised in an iterative process. We demonstrate the application of the framework through several use cases. Each use case represents different data integration requirements and is based on different services of the proposed framework.

AB  - In many fields involving complex environments or living organisms, data-driven models are useful to make simulations in order to extrapolate costly experiments and to design decision-support tools. Learning methods can be used to build interpretable models from data. However, to be really useful, such models must be trusted by their users. From this perspective, the domain expert knowledge can be collected and modeled to help guiding the learning process and to increase the confidence in the resulting models, as well as their relevance. Another issue is to design relevant ontologies to formalize complex knowledge. Interpretable predictive models can help in this matter. In this paper, we propose a generic iterative approach to design ontology-aware and relevant data-driven models. It is based upon an ontology to model the domain knowledge and a learning method to build the interpretable models (decision trees in this paper). Subjective and objective evaluations are both involved in the process. A case study in the domain of Food Industry demonstrates the interest of this approach. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Anonymous Indexing of Health Conditions for a Similarity Measure

T2  - IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine
AB  - A health social network is an online information service which facilitates information sharing between closely related members of a community with the same or a similar health condition. Over the years, many automated recommender systems have been developed for social networking in order to help users find their communities of interest. For health social networking, the ideal source of information for measuring similarities of patients is the medical information of the patients. However, it is not desirable that such sensitive and private information be shared over the Internet. This is also true for many other security sensitive domains. A new information-sharing scheme is developed where each patient is represented as a small number of (possibly disjoint) d-words (discriminant words) and the d-words are used to measure similarities between patients without revealing sensitive personal information. The d-words are simple words like “food,'' and thus do not contain identifiable personal information. This makes our method an effective one-way hashing of patient assessments for a similarity measure. The d-words can be easily shared on the Internet to find peers who might have similar health conditions.

AB  - Semantics have become acceptable techniques for data integration, data interoperability and data visualization in many software engineering domains and web developments over the past few years. This paper describes a software development where semantic ontology techniques have been used for developing a generic knowledge model applicable across rural industries. This technique enables us to outline a single access point for building end-user specific knowledge based systems. We have called the new solution prototype an End-User Enabled Design Environment (EUEDE) where the knowledge components from the problem ontology is used in building specific decision systems that are context-sensitive to end-user factors. Illustrating with an application from the dairy industry, we describe the design architecture and theory, and argue its generic capability to application in other problem domains. © 2007 IEEE.

AB  - Increasing the efficiency of agricultural production is a very important task. To solve this problem, it is proposed to use the "Smart Farming" cloud system for precision farming management. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in using the knowledge base and multi-agent technology to develop coordinated decisions on management of agricultural enterprises. The paper focuses on development of the knowledge base in the "Smart Farming" system on precision agriculture. Information storage is organized in the form of a semantic network of concepts and relations on the "All about the concept" principle in a single repository, which facilitates the work of farmers with this resource. The paper covers storage, editing, verification, and visualization of knowledge representation about the domain of crop production, production resources, agricultural machinery, equipment and other material resources, as well as peculiarities of the tasks of precision farming. The knowledge base of plant production, built on ontological principles, will be useful to enterprise managers, agronomists, machine operators, planning services and other specialists of large, medium and small farms, as well as to individual farmers.

AB  - Decision support systems (DSS) support business or organizational decision-making activities, which require the access to information that is internally stored in databases or data warehouses, and externally in the Web accessed by Information Retrieval (IR) or Question Answering (QA) systems. Graphical interfaces to query these sources of information ease to constrain dynamically query formulation based on user selections, but they present a lack of flexibility in query formulation, since the expressivity power is reduced to the user interface design. Natural language interfaces (NLI) are expected as the optimal solution. However, especially for non-expert users, a real natural communication is the most difficult to realize effectively.In this paper, we propose an NLI that improves the interaction between the user and the DSS by means of referencing previous questions or their answers (i.e. anaphora such as the pronoun reference in "What traits are affected by them?"), or by eliding parts of the question (i.e. ellipsis such as "And to glume colour?" after the question "Tell me the QTLs related to awn colour in wheat"). Moreover, in order to overcome one of the main problems of NLIs about the difficulty to adapt an NLI to a new domain, our proposal is based on ontologies that are obtained semi-automatically from a framework that allows the integration of internal and external, structured and unstructured information. Therefore, our proposal can interface with databases, data warehouses, QA and IR systems. Because of the high NL ambiguity of the resolution process, our proposal is presented as an authoring tool that helps the user to query efficiently in natural language. Finally, our proposal is tested on a DSS case scenario about Biotechnology and Agriculture, whose knowledge base is the CEREALAB database as internal structured data, and the Web (e.g. PubMed) as external unstructured information. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - An agri-food value chain (VC) represents a set of activities aimed at delivering highly valuable products to the market. Due to the diversity of actors in the agri-food VCs´ accumulated knowledge is typically situated within the boundaries of each entity of the VC. Hence, the question is how to improve knowledge sharing in agri-food VC, or more specifically how can knowledge flow and mobilize among different actors in the VC. To answer this question, we present a decision support system (DSS) for evaluation of knowledge sharing crossing boundaries in agri-food VC. The proposed DSS is developed through two phases: (i) identification of the most common knowledge boundaries by using machine learning and ontology technologies; (ii) transformation of the obtained ontology into a DSS for the evaluation of existing knowledge boundaries. In particular, the developed DSS helps in identifying, evaluating and providing directions for improvement of the knowledge sharing crossing boundaries in agri-food VC. We apply the DSS to evaluate three real VCs: a tomato VC in Argentina, a Chinese leaf VC in China and a brassica VC in the UK. The comparative analysis across the three varied case studies and their evaluation with the proposed DSS lead to more insights into knowledge-based decisions that a particular VC needs to address to improve its knowledge flow, in particular, to obtain insights in the transparency and interoperability of data and knowledge crossing boundaries in agri-food VCs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Recent research has identified a few design flaws in popular mobile health (mHealth) applications for promoting healthy eating lifestyle, such as mobile food journals. These include tediousness of manual food logging, inadequate food database coverage, and a lack of healthy dietary goal setting. To address these issues, we present Foodbot, a chatbot-based mHealth application for goal-oriented just-in-time (JIT) healthy eating interventions. Powered by a large-scale food knowledge graph, Foodbot utilizes automatic speech recognition and mobile messaging interface to record food intake. Moreover, Foodbot allows users to set goals and guides their behavior toward the goals via JIT notification prompts, interactive dialogues, and personalized recommendation. Altogether, the Foodbot framework demonstrates the use of open-source data, tools, and platforms to build a practical mHealth solution for supporting healthy eating lifestyle in the general population.  © 2020 ACM.

AB  - Accurate action recommendations can enhance the convenience of daily life, such as automatically turning on the dining area lights during meals or playing music based on residential habits. Generating precise recommendations for the next household device actions is essential for future smart homes. This paper proposes an action recommendation system for household appliance scenarios by customizing the knowledge graph attention network in its sampling and aggregation, in which the usage habits, periods, and location information were used as common sense for graph modelling. The results of the recommendations can be explained by a designed method with the trained embeddings. Finally, with the recommendation expectation, appliances' comfort level and average power are modelled as a multi-objective optimization problem for participating in demand response. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed system can achieve 93.4% accuracy in recommendations and reduce the power consumption by 20% while providing reasonable explanations.

T2  - ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN AGRICULTURE
AB  - Crops grown on aquaponics farms are susceptible to various diseases or biotic stresses during their growth cycle, just like traditional agriculture. The early detection of diseases is crucial to witnessing the efficiency and progress of the aquaponics system. Aquaponics combines recirculating aquaculture and soilless hydroponics methods and promises to ensure food security, reduce water scarcity, and eliminate carbon footprint. For the large-scale implementation of this farming technique, a unified system is needed that can detect crop diseases and support researchers and farmers in identifying potential causes and treatments at early stages. This study proposes an automatic crop diagnostic system for detecting biotic stresses and managing diseases in four leafy green crops, lettuce, basil, spinach, and parsley, grown in an aquaponics facility. First, a dataset comprising 2640 images is constructed. Then, a disease detection system is developed that works in three phases. The first phase is a crop classification system that identifies the type of crop. The second phase is a disease identification system that determines the crop's health status. The final phase is a disease detection system that localizes and detects the diseased and healthy spots in leaves and categorizes the disease. The proposed approach has shown promising results with accuracy in each of the three phases, reaching 95.83%, 94.13%, and 82.13%, respectively. The final disease detection system is then integrated with an ontology model through a cloud-based application. This ontology model contains domain knowledge related to crop pathology, particularly causes and treatments of different diseases of the studied leafy green crops, which can be automatically extracted upon disease detection allowing agricultural practitioners to take precautionary measures. The proposed application finds its significance as a decision support system that can automate aquaponics facility health monitoring and assist agricultural practitioners in decision-making processes regarding crop and disease management.(c) 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Sentiment analysis is used to design a recommender system many different sectors, including all the restaurant and food sectors. The majority of these recommenders, however, rely on fixed information like cuisine, price, and service quality. By determining the users’ dietary preferences and examining their choices, these systems produce customised recommendations. The usage of a scenario suggestion system is advised since it may identify people’s meal preferences based on their comments and propose restaurants that cater to those preferences. Food names are gathered and categorised using user comments to evaluate user sentiment. The constancy of the choices suggests a nearby restaurant that really is open for business. A data collection contains different user reviews. The platform’s precision, recalls, and f-measure are evaluated using three alternative scenarios top-1, top-3, and top-5. With such a 92.8% precision rate, the proposed technique is expected to provide users with exceptionally accurate recommendations. In proposed project we are including more features like the waiting time, main course, reachability, and deserts. We considered data on restaurants and over 2990 reviews on these restaurants as a dataset and we will be generating the data plot using LSTM and GRU algorithms.

T2  - Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety
AB  - Big data analysis has found applications in many industries due to its ability to turn huge amounts of data into insights for informed business and operational decisions. Advanced data mining techniques have been applied in many sectors of supply chains in the food industry. However, the previous work has mainly focused on the analysis of instrument-generated data such as those from hyperspectral imaging, spectroscopy, and biometric receptors. The importance of digital text data in the food and nutrition has only recently gained attention due to advancements in big data analytics. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the data sources, computational methods, and applications of text data in the food industry. Text mining techniques such as word-level analysis (e.g., frequency analysis), word association analysis (e.g., network analysis), and advanced techniques (e.g., text classification, text clustering, topic modeling, information retrieval, and sentiment analysis) will be discussed. Applications of text data analysis will be illustrated with respect to food safety and food fraud surveillance, dietary pattern characterization, consumer-opinion mining, new-product development, food knowledge discovery, food supply-chain management, and online food services. The goal is to provide insights for intelligent decision-making to improve food production, food safety, and human nutrition. © 2020 Institute of Food Technologists®

T2  - FUTURE INTERNET
AB  - Huge advances in peer-to-peer systems and attempts to develop the semantic web have revealed a critical issue in information systems across multiple domains: the absence of semantic interoperability. Today, businesses operating in a digital environment require increased supply-chain automation, interoperability, and data governance. While research on the semantic web and interoperability has recently received much attention, a dearth of studies investigates the relationship between these two concepts in depth. To address this knowledge gap, the objective of this study is to conduct a review and bibliometric analysis of 3511 Scopus-registered papers on the semantic web and interoperability published over the past two decades. In addition, the publications were analyzed using a variety of bibliometric indicators, such as publication year, journal, authors, countries, and institutions. Keyword co-occurrence and co-citation networks were utilized to identify the primary research hotspots and group the relevant literature. The findings of the review and bibliometric analysis indicate the dominance of conference papers as a means of disseminating knowledge and the substantial contribution of developed nations to the semantic web field. In addition, the keyword co-occurrence network analysis reveals a significant emphasis on semantic web languages, sensors and computing, graphs and models, and linking and integration techniques. Based on the co-citation clustering, the Internet of Things, semantic web services, ontology mapping, building information modeling, bioinformatics, education and e-learning, and semantic web languages were identified as the primary themes contributing to the flow of knowledge and the growth of the semantic web and interoperability field. Overall, this review substantially contributes to the literature and increases scholars' and practitioners' awareness of the current knowledge composition and future research directions of the semantic web field.

AB  - In recent years, the surge in social media platform usage has sparked a heightened interest in applying recommender systems (RSs) within the food industry. Traditionally, the exploration of user interests focused on analyzing behaviors linked to food selection. The availability of user interaction datasets now provides avenues for deeper insights into food content and intricate user relationships. This paper advocates strategically integrating Heterogeneous Information Networks (HIN) into recommender system frameworks. It introduces the Heterogeneous Attention Network-based User Interests-Aware Food Recommender System (UIFRS-HAN), designed for personalized food recommendations. By leveraging HIN and a two-step attention mechanism, UIFRS-HAN captures diverse entities and relationships within a unified framework. UIFRS-HAN employs an attention technique to reconstruct node features and edges, incorporating a dual hierarchical attention mechanism for improved unsupervised learning of attributed graph representations. Besides, HIN allows the model to uncover meaningful relationships between nodes, particularly when directed relationships are unclear. Through a defined meta-path-based attention mechanism, UIFRS-HAN generates diverse recommendations based on users’ interests across various relations among different types of nodes of the HIN. By discerning intricate patterns and correlations, UIFRS-HAN surpasses traditional approaches in delivering refined and contextually relevant recommendations. The proposed model enhances representation depth and accuracy by employing node embedding through a hierarchical meta-path structure. Rigorous testing on Allrecipes.com and Food.com datasets, compared against 15 baselines and state-of-the-art models, confirms the technical soundness and superiority of UIFRS-HAN in providing precise and personalized food recommendations. © 2024 The Author(s)

TI  - Cloud-based Decision Support and Automation for Precision Agriculture in Orchards
AU  - Tan, L.
T2  - IFAC-PapersOnLine
AB  - Recent technological and commercial developments make cloud computing an affordable, scalable, and highly-available platform technology. Meanwhile, precision agriculture is showing its potentials by improving agricultural operations through better data-driven decision making. Nevertheless, further development of precision agriculture requires better technology and tools to process data efficiently at a reasonable cost, and to translate the data to better decisions and actions in a field. We developed a framework for cloud-based Decision Support and Automation systems that can acquire data from various sources, synthesize application-specific decisions, and control field devices from the Cloud. A distinctive feature of our framework is its extensible software architecture: decision modules can be added and/or configured for a specific operation. The platform features a device-agnostic frontend that can process incoming data in different formats and semantics. Finally, the platform incorporates software-defined control, a new software design paradigm we proposed to enable versatile and safe control of field devices from a cloud computing platform. An early version of the system has been developed and tested with support from the USDA. © 2016

AB  - With the continuous expansion of the scale of e-government, personalized recommendation technology has been widely used. However, the traditional recommendation system has been unable to meet the needs of the current data processing, and good big data processing ability has become the basic requirement of the new personalized recommendation system, Combined with the application background of big data: firstly, this paper puts forward the construction method of personalized information service system with portal as the core, including the construction object, mode, goal and principle system. After information integration, in order to improve the security of the system, the authority management and access control are introduced. Secondly, a unified model is established to describe the integration of information resources and user files. Thirdly, the data mining method is used to discover the user's interest in integrated information. Combined with Hadoop cloud computing platform, the distributed construction of the model is realized, and the stability of the classic collaborative filtering algorithm is improved. Finally, a fuzzy semantic model of personalized recommendation system is proposed and implemented with a fuzzy description logic language.

AB  - Pests in crops produce important economic loses all around the world. To deal with them without damaging people or the environment, governments have established strict legislation and norms describing the products and procedures of use. However, since these norms frequently change to reflect scientific and technological advances, it is needed to perform a frequent review of affected norms in order to update pest related information systems. This is not an easy task because they are usually human-oriented, so intensive manual labour is required. To facilitate the use of this information, this work proposes the construction of a recommendation system that facilitates the identification of pests and the selection of suitable treatments. The core of this system is an ontology that models the interactions between crops, pests and treatments.

AB  - In the context of the rapid development of artificial intelligence and big data technology, the efficient use and integration of data are essential. As a tool for information carrying and knowledge reasoning in the context of big data, a knowledge graph helps to improve the utilization of land resources in villages and towns and the accurate supply of knowledge services. To effectively solve services such as land cultivation guidance, business guidance, and policy consultation, a land big data knowledge service system based on a knowledge graph is proposed. The construction framework and content of the land big data knowledge service system are studied from the technical and functional levels and applied to the land knowledge service platform to provide service functions such as intelligent retrieval, online consultation, land purchase and sale, and personalized recommendation. This service system is expected to provide reference and reference for the research, development, and technological innovation of villages and towns in the era of big data.

AB  - Global warming causes increasing natural disasters and gradually threatens human life and property safety. Under such an uncertain environment, efficiency and effectiveness in the energy management are an important and a difficult question. This paper aims to provide an approach for energy management that optimizes the relationship between different variables such as time, areas, countries, users, seasons, evaluation methods, and various different energy productions such as nuclear, water, biomass, wind, solar, and thermal. To achieve this goal, this paper combines the technologies of ontology and fuzzy markup language (FML) with theories about uncertainty to evaluate the applicability of the energy production based on technological innovation, economic development, social safety, environmental protection, regional characteristics, and time series. The simulation results show that the proposed approach is feasible to provide an alternative for energy management through the viewpoints of people, governments, and enterprises. It is hoped to provide the optimized energy management decision model for different decision makers and users as a reference in the future.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) provides unprecedented opportunities for the access to and conflation of a myriad of heterogeneous data to support real-time decision-making within smart environments. Augmented Reality (AR) is on cusp of becoming mainstream and will allow for the ubiquitous visualization of IoT derived data. Such visualization will simultaneously permit the cognitive and visual binding of information to the physical object(s) to which they pertain. Important questions exist as to how one can efficiently filter, prioritize, determine relevance and adjudicate on individual information needs in support of real-time decision making. To this end, this paper proposes a novel AR decision support framework (STARE) to support immediate decisions within a smart environment by augmenting the user’s focal objects with assemblies of semantically relevant IoT data and corresponding suggestions. In order to evaluate this technique, a remote user study was undertaken within a simulated smart home environment. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed Semantic Augmented Reality decision support framework leads to a reduction in information overloading and enhanced effectiveness, both in terms of IoT data interpretation and decision support.

AB  - With the recent advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT), it is now possible to process a large number of sensor data streams using different large-scale IoT platforms. These IoT frameworks are used to collect, process and analyse data streams in real-time and facilitate provision of smart solutions designed to provide decision support. Existing IoT-based solutions are mainly domain-dependent, providing stream processing and analytics focusing on specific areas (smart cities, healthcare etc.). In the context of agri-food industry, a variety of external parameters belonging to different domains (e.g. weather conditions, regulations etc.) have a major influence over the food supply chain, while flexible and adaptive IoT frameworks, essential to truly realize the concept of smart farming, are currently inexistent. In this paper, we propose Agri-IoT, a semantic framework for IoT-based smart farming applications, which supports reasoning over various heterogeneous sensor data streams in real-time. Agri-IoT can integrate multiple cross-domain data streams, providing a complete semantic processing pipeline, offering a common framework for smart farming applications. Agri-IoT supports large-scale data analytics and event detection, ensuring seamless interoperability among sensors, services, processes, operations, farmers and other relevant actors, including online information sources and linked open datasets and streams available on the Web.

AB  - Food waste and loss is a global issue involving ethics, society, the environment, and the economy. However, there is a lack of systematic and visual scientific knowledge and graph methods to study the precedents of this field’s development over time. The article is based on the scientific knowledge graph research of articles published in the past 22 years to review the latest food waste research developments. The study will be conducted from the following perspectives: country/region, institution, author, journal, keyword co-occurrence, and article co-citation. It turns out that in the past eight years, food waste research has grown rapidly. A total of 8298 research articles have been published in 8064 journals and 176 Web of Science (WOS) subject categories. Research shows in the past 20 years. The main research hotspots were anaerobic digestion, biogas production, composting, biological hydrogen production, and innovation in system management methods. In the future, efficient and multitask biological value-added conversion technology, systematization of food-supply-chain decision-making aid models, and research on differences in management strategies may become the frontiers of research. © 2021 by the authors.

T2  - Ecological Informatics
AB  - The main reason for agricultural productivity decline is farmers' failure to choose the appropriate crop for their soil. It is important for farmers to understand which crops are suitable for different soil types based on their characteristics. Due to the vast variety of soil types worldwide, farmers often struggle to choose the most profitable crop for their land. To improve crop yields, a crop selection system has been developed using GBRT-based deep learning surrogate models. Gradient Boosted Regression Tree (GBRT) has been combined with a Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm to determine the most optimal hyperparameters for the deep neural network. The optimized hyperparameters are then applied during the testing phase. Further, the impact of each input parameter on the individual outputs is evaluated using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). The crop recommendation system comprises data preparation, classification, and performance evaluation modules. A classification method based on confusion matrices and performance matrices, as well as feature analysis using density plots and correlation plots, follows. The crop selection system categorizes the experimental dataset into 12 classes, with three for each of the four crops. The dataset includes soil-specific physical and chemical features such as sand, silt, clay, pH, electric conductivity (EC), soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). The developed surrogate model is highly accurate, precise, and reliable, with an F1-Score of 1.0 for all classes in the dataset, indicating exact accuracy and recall. The DNN-based classification model achieves an average classification accuracy of 1.00. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sentiment analysis is now widely used in the creation of recommender systems in a variety of areas, as well as the restaurant and food service industries. Most restaurant recommender systems based on sentiment analysis, on the other hand, depend only on static data such food quality, cost, and service quality. Personalised suggestions are generated by analysing user views and extracting their dietary preferences, which is a study need in the literature. A context-aware recommender system is suggested in this study, which extracts people's food preferences from their comments and proposes restaurants based on those choices. Finally, adjacent open eateries are suggested depending on how well they match the user's choices. The Kaggle platform was utilised for review, and feedback from various users was gathered. The system's In three scenarios, accuracy, recall, and f-measure are evaluated for the Wu-palmer module: top1, top3, and top5. The same dataset was used to measure the cosine similarity and the Jaccard similarity, and their accuracy and precision were calculated, and these three modules were compared. The findings show that the suggested systems can deliver suggestions with 92.8 percent (Wu-Palmer) accuracy, 87 percent for cosine similarity, and 82 percent for Jaccard similarity. Giving users a high level of precision, Wu-Palmer has the greatest accuracy compared to the other two Cosine and Jaccard Similarity algorithms. Furthermore, in these areas the system exceeds past studies.

AB  - The rapid development of information and communication technologies and wireless sensor networks has transformed agriculture practices. New tools and methods are used to support farmers in their activities. This paper presents a context-aware system that automates irrigation decisions based on sensor measurements. Automatic irrigation overcomes the water shortage problem, and automatic sensor measurements reduce the observational work of farmers. This paper focuses on a method for developing context-aware systems using ontologies. Ontologies are used to solve heterogeneity issues in sensor measurements. Their main goal is to propose a shared data schema that precisely describes measurements to ease their interpretations. These descriptions are reusable by any machine and understandable by humans. The context-aware system also contains a decision support system based on a rules inference engine. We propose two new ontologies: The Context-Aware System Ontology addresses the development of the context-aware system in general. The Irrigation ontology automates a manual irrigation method named IRRINOV®. These ontologies reuse well-known ontologies such as the Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) and Smart Appliance REFerence (SAREF). The decision support system uses a set of rules with ontologies to infer daily irrigation decisions for farmers. This project uses real experimental data to evaluate the implementation of the decision support system. © 2020 by the authors.

T2  - Journal of Dairy Science
AB  - Management decisions can be informed by near-real-time data streams to improve the economics of the farm and to positively benefit the overall health of a dairy herd or the larger environment. Decision support tools can use data management services and analytics to exploit data streams from farm and other economic, health, and agricultural sources. We will describe a decision support tool that couples data analytics tools to underlying cow, herd, and economic data with an application programming interface. This interface allows the user to interact with a collection of dairy applications without fully exposing the intricacies of the underlying system model and understand the effects of different decisions on outputs of interest. The collection of these applications will form the basis of the Dairy Brain decision support system, which will provide management suggestions to farmers at a single animal or farm level. Dairy operations data will be gathered, cleaned, organized, and disseminated through an agricultural data hub, exploiting newly developed ontologies for integration of multiple data sources. Models of feed efficiency, culling, or other dairy operations (such as large capital expenditures, outsourcing opportunities, and interactions with regulators) form the basis of analytical approaches, operationalized via tools that help secure information and control uncertainties. The applications will be independently generated to provide flexibility, and use tools and modeling approaches from the data science, simulation, machine learning, and optimization disciplines to provide specific recommendations to decision makers. The Dairy Brain is a decision support system that couples data analytics tools with a suite of applications that integrate cow, herd, and economic data to inform management, operational, and animal health improving practices. Research challenges that remain include dealing with increased variability as predictions go from herd or pen level down to individual cow level and choosing the appropriate tool or technique to deal with a specific problem. © 2020 American Dairy Science Association

AB  - Popularity of the Internet of things (IoT) is currently on the rise. Academia as well as industry is equally fascinated by this disruptive technology. The IoT research and implementation have succeeded securing their place in numerous domains including, but not limited to, business, transportation and logistics, health care, smart cities, and agriculture. Conceptual modeling is pivotal to the design and implementation of a system. Various modeling approaches have been used for a variety of the IoT applications and case studies. In this paper, we examine various innovative applications of the existing conceptual modeling approaches for the IoT. We analyze the use of these approaches against different concerns in isolation as well as in mutual combination for the IoT. We also define a set of terminologies that we frequently encounter in this manuscript and those likely to be used while adopting proposed modeling approaches for the IoT scenarios. This study also attempts to reconcile different modeling approaches toward a unified modeling system. For this purpose, we map various conceptual modeling approaches against different layers of functional model of the IoT reference architecture. There is also a scenario in the end of the paper which elaborates the use of different modeling approaches in hierarchy for a complex IoT system.

AB  - Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is an autoimmune disease causing insulin deficiency and impaired blood sugar control. Managing postprandial glucose response (PGR) is a major challenge in T1DM, as it necessitates precise insulin dosing prior to meals. The potential of the artificial pancreas lies in its integration of insulin delivery and glucose monitoring, but accurate incorporation of meal information remains an open challenge. While machine learning methodologies could help in addressing this issue, most existing models lack interpretability and comprehension of the output. This study aims to assess the influence of various metabolic features on the prediction of postprandial Blood Glucose Levels (BGLs) using eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methodologies. Two distinct prediction models are developed, considering varying prediction horizons following the meal (15 min and 60 min). Specifically, BGLs prediction models incorporate preprandial blood glucose values, insulin, meal carbohydrate intake, and glycemic index and load as input variable. To evaluate their impact, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), a method that provides insights into the contribution of each feature to the model predictions, was employed. By leveraging XAI methodologies, the study aims to improve the interpretability and transparency of BGLs prediction models. The findings of this research can contribute to the development of decision-support tools for patients affected by T1DM, helping the management of PGR and reducing the risks of adverse events. © 2023 IEEE.

T2  - 2016 IEEE 17th International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration (IRI)
AB  - Precision agriculture is a data-driven farming practice that uses intra-and inter-field information to optimize farming operations. The "brain" of precision agriculture is a decision support system (DSS) that acquires data from various sources, analyzes them, and recommends actions to farmers. Recently cloud computing has been used to improve the scalability and reliability of a DSS. Cloud-based DSSs present some major challenges for software design:(1) how can a cloud-based DSS process a diversified profile of intra-and/or inter-field data from various sources? (2) how can a cloud-based DSS accommodate and support the diversity of farming operations? (3) how can a cloud-based DSS automate the entire decision process and control field devices directly? we proposed an extensible cloud-based software platform that integrated 3 novel components to address these questions: (1) a meta-model-based data acquisition and integration module that accepts data in different formats and semantics, (2) an adaptive software architecture supporting on-the-fly re-configuration of decision modules, and (3) software-defined control, a new software design paradigm we proposed for handling control diversity. It enables a DSS to control various field devices through unified software-defined interfaces. We implemented the platform in Agrilaxy, a cloud-based DSS, and deployed it on Amazon Web Services (AWS). An early version of Agrilaxy has been used in a USDA-sponsored project on canopy management for specialty crops.

AU  - Zeb, A

T2  - FOOD AND BIOPRODUCTS PROCESSING
AB  - The food sector is driven by a large number of actors, including primary producers, manufacturers, logistics providers, retailers, and consumers. At each phase of the food value chain, a significant amount of data is generated that provides important information to the agents involved in processing and flow of food products from farm to fork. Proper handling of food data has a crucial role in providing safe, quality and affordable products to the increasing world population. The independent production of food data, without following any specific guidelines and procedures, often results in inconsistent and incomparable datasets that cannot be directly utilised by multiple users. Data harmonisation means reconciling various types, levels and sources of data in formats that are compatible and comparable, and thus useful for better decision making. In the food sector, one way of performing data harmonisation is to represent food data according to reliable classification and description systems. Another approach towards harmonisation is to match various food concepts to the existing and widely used ontologies. Furthermore, harmonisation is facilitated by following specific guidelines and procedures during data collection processes. This study explores some of the most important tools, frameworks and methodologies for data harmonisation in the food sector. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

T2  - 2018 International Seminar on Research of Information Technology and Intelligent Systems (ISRITI)
AB  - Complementary breastfeeding should be given to infants in age 6-24 months because at this age babies begin vulnerable to malnutrition. In Indonesia, giving complementary breastfeeding in the first year of life affects 60% of the 10.9 million child deaths each year. Giving complementary breastfeeding, need to considerate infant age, the ingredient used, and malnutrition condition because they affect on the fulfillment of nutritional needs for the babies. This study proposes the development of a decision support system (DSS) for complementary breastfeeding recipe to meet the daily nutritional needs of infants according to their physical condition. The steps taken in this research are collecting data, integrating complementary breastfeeding and pediatric nutrition ontology model, validation by nutritionists and pediatricians, as well as the implementation and testing. This study successfully built a complementary breastfeeding recipe DSS which are concerning infant's age, nutritional needs, ingredient preferences, and malnutrition suffered. Test results show that the contained functions in the application of these recommendations had been as expected, based on testing by nutritionists and pediatricians. Evaluation by ten users (mothers of infants aged 6-24 months) shows the user satisfaction for the information presented by the applications to the average value for the entire state is 4.004 on a scale of 1 to 5.

AB  - The education system worldwide has been affected by the Corona Virus Diseases 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, resulting in the interruption of all educational institutions. Moreover, as a precautionary measure, the lockdown has been imposed that has severely affected the learning processes, especially assessment activities, including exams and viva. In such challenging situations, E-learning platforms could play a vital role in conducting seamless academic activities. In spite of all the advantages of remote learning systems, many hurdles and obstacles, like a selection of suitable learning resources/material encounter by individual users based on their interests or requirements. Especially those who are not well familiar with the internet technology in developing countries and are in need of a platform that could help them in resolving the issues related to the online virtual environment. Therefore, in this work, we have proposed a mechanism that intelligently and correctly predicts the appropriate preferences for the selection of resources relevant to a specific user by considering the capabilities of diverse perspectives users to provide quality online education and to make work from home policy more effective and progressive during the pandemic. The proposed system helps teachers in providing quality online education, familiarizing them with advanced technology in the online environment. It also semantically predicts the preferences for virtual assistance of those users who are in need of learning the new tools and technologies in short time as per their institutional requirements in order to meet the quality standards of online education. The experimental and statistical results have demonstrated that the proposed virtual personalized preferences system has improved overall academic activities as compared to the current method. The proposed system enhanced user's learning abilities and facilitated them in selecting short courses while using different online education tools adopted/suggested by the institutions to conduct online classes/seminars/webinars etc., as compared to the conventional classes/activities.

T2  - Computational Intelligence
AB  - Agriculture serves as the predominant driver of a country's economy, constituting the largest share of the nation's manpower. Most farmers are facing a problem in choosing the most appropriate crop that can yield better based on the environmental conditions and make profits for them. As a consequence of this, there will be a notable decline in their overall productivity. Precision agriculture has effectively resolved the issues encountered by farmers. Today's farmers may benefit from what's known as precision agriculture. This method takes into account local climate, soil type, and past crop yields to determine which varieties will provide the best results. The explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) technique is used with radial basis functions neural network and spider monkey optimization to classify suitable crops based on the underlying soil and environmental conditions. The XAI technology would provide assets in better transparency of the prediction model on deciding the most suitable crops for their farms, taking into account a variety of geographical and operational criteria. The proposed model is assessed using standard metrics like precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-score. In contrast to other cutting-edge approaches discussed in this study, the model has shown fair performance with approximately 12% better accuracy than the other models considered in the current study. Similarly, precision has improvised by 10%, recall by 11%, and F1-score by 10%. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - The development of Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs) offers an opportunity for understanding user preferences and promoting Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation. The user preferences usually change when the environment changes, which will affect the performance of POI recommendation. Many existing methods extract the environmental features from static regions, but they cannot capture user preferences in real time with the fine-grained changes in user locations. Meanwhile, the similarity of POI categories, which is significant to capture user preferences, is usually ignored. To address these issues, we propose RegDM, a region-aware POI recommendation model that employs a semantic spatial graph to model the relations among POIs. With the semantic spatial graph, RegDM uses a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to extract fine-grained region features and user preferences for personalized recommendation. We evaluate RegDM on two datasets, and the experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.

AB  - Traditional recommendation systems usually use single user-item interaction information, which ignore the multiple relationships that exist for other interactions (e.g., likes, clicks). Multi-behavioral recommendation models compensate for the shortcomings of traditional models. The existing multi-behavior recommendation models focus on obtaining behavioral information by distinguishing the interaction differences of multiple user behaviors but ignore the common preferences of items related to user different interactions. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Behavior Heterogeneous Contrastive learning Recommendation (MBHCR) model. Specifically, MBHCR stresses the information fusion between different interaction behaviors and differences in the behavior view. Firstly, we design a unified heterogeneous graph based on the complexity of user multi-behavioral interaction information to distinguish behavioral differences while preserving their complete semantic information. Secondly, we propose a multi-behavior relational aggregator component to model the unified heterogeneous graph only once to capture the potential common representations of users and their different interactions and to mitigate user sparsity. Thirdly, we also design a behavior comparison learning enhancer to complement the interaction differences between the user’s target behavior and auxiliary behaviors on the behavior view and extract valid information. Experiments were conducted on two real-world datasets to demonstrate the validity of MBHCR and designed ablation experiments to verify the contribution of model components.

AB  - We compared two sorts of explanations for decisions made by an AI system: counterfactual explanations about how an outcome could have been different in the past, and prefactual explanations about how it could be different in the future. We examined the effects of these alternative explanation strategies on the accuracy of users' judgments about the AI app's predictions about an outcome (inferred from information about the causes), compared to the accuracy of their judgments about the app's diagnoses of a cause (inferred from information about the outcome). The tasks were based on a simulated SmartAgriculture decision support system for grass growth outcomes on dairy farms in Experiment 1, and for an analogous alien planet domain in Experiment 2. The two experiments, with 243 participants, also tested users' confidence in their decisions, and their satisfaction with the explanations. Users made more accurate diagnoses of the presence of causes based on information about their outcome, compared to predictions of an outcome given information about the presence of causes. Their predictions and diagnoses were helped equally by counterfactual explanations and prefactual ones.  © 2022 Owner/Author.

AB  - In the discussion on the increasing demand for food, which is to be met by efficient and sustainable increases in productivity, animal welfare is becoming increasingly important. Animal health issues must be identified to prevent epidemics that significantly impact the economic performance of farms or even cause societal harm. The use of cutting-edge technologies (IoT, sensors, Big Data processing, etc.) is increasingly enabling early intervention in livestock farming to curb productivity losses through real-time monitoring, alerts, and decision support. The ubiquity of these technological solutions has enabled stakeholders to create more robust agricultural supply chains, that deliver sustainable nutrition for a growing population. However, the increasing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is responsible for many of the current breakthroughs in Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) and agriculture in general, has meant that modern decision-support solutions have increasingly transitioned toward black box systems. It has become apparent that a gap exists between efforts to develop more advanced machine learning models, and the growing demands for ethical assessment and transparency in agriculture decision-making. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is one such solution that could prove effective in overcoming the current limitations of black-box models, by allowing the decision-making process of such models to be explored. Through a literature review, we evaluate the potential of XAI in various agricultural use cases and demonstrate the potential benefits of its application to precision livestock management. © ECPLF 2022.

AB  - Crop production problems are common in Sri Lanka which severely effect rural farmers, agriculture sector and the country's economy as a whole. A deeper analysis revealed that the root cause was farmers and other stakeholders in the domain not receiving right information at the right time in the right format. Inspired by the rapid growth of mobile phone usage among farmers a mobile-based solution is sought to overcome this information gap. Farmers needed published information (quasi static) about crops, pests, diseases, land preparation, growing and harvesting methods and real-time situational information (dynamic) such as current crop production and market prices. This situational information is also needed by agriculture department, agro-chemical companies, buyers and various government agencies to ensure food security through effective supply chain planning whilst minimising waste. We developed a notion of context specific actionable information which enables user to act with least amount of further processing. User centered agriculture ontology was developed to convert published quasi static information to actionable information. We adopted empowerment theory to create empowerment-oriented farming processes to motivate farmers to act on this information and aggregated the transaction data to generate situational information. This created a holistic information flow model for agriculture domain similar to energy flow in biological ecosystems. Consequently, the initial Mobile-based Information System evolved into a Digital Knowledge Ecosystem that can predict current production situation in near real enabling government agencies to dynamically adjust the incentives offered to farmers for growing different types of crops to achieve sustainable agriculture production through crop diversification.

AB  - Enzymatic hydrolysis of the main components of lignocellulosic biomass is one of the promising methods to further upgrading it into biofuels. Biomass pre-treatment is an essential step in order to reduce cellulose crystallinity, increase surface and porosity and separate the major constituents of biomass. Scientific literature in this domain is increasing fast and could be a valuable source of data. As these abundant scientific data are mostly in textual format and heterogeneously structured, using them to compute biomass pre-treatment efficiency is not straightforward. This paper presents the implementation of a Decision Support System (DSS) based on an original pipeline coupling knowledge engineering (KE) based on semantic web technologies, soft computing techniques and environmental factor computation. The DSS allows using data found in the literature to assess environmental sustainability of biorefinery systems. The pipeline permits to: (1) structure and integrate relevant experimental data, (2) assess data source reliability, (3) compute and visualize green indicators taking into account data imprecision and source reliability. This pipeline has been made possible thanks to innovative researches in the coupling of ontologies, uncertainty management and propagation. In this first version, data acquisition is done by experts and facilitated by a termino-ontological resource. Data source reliability assessment is based on domain knowledge and done by experts. The operational prototype has been used by field experts on a realistic use case (rice straw). The obtained results have validated the usefulness of the system. Further work will address the question of a higher automation level for data acquisition and data source reliability assessment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A traceability system can quickly and accurately query product supply chain circulation information. It is difficult to obtain processing information and achieve sharing due to the big data, long duration, large amount of equipment and scattered and easily lost processing information. In tracing the application of the case-based reasoning (CBR) to product processing, we can solve the problem of establishing an accurate and complete mathematical model between the processing information and product quality defects by finding a target record in a large amount of historical data. The traceability model of ontology and CBR uses the web ontology language (OWL) for case representation to simplify the CBR framework for big data, classifies process data and standardizes information storage. A joint optimization algorithm based on the genetic algorithm (GA) and CBR is proposed to establish an optimization model of process traceability, which is applied to case retrieval and reuse. This algorithm optimizes the genetic operator by combining the optimal preservation strategy and roulette selection method and uses an exponential-scale transformation method to stretch the fitness function. The experiments show that the optimized traceability model can infer information from garbled codes, wrong codes and missing messages to quickly determine the problematic products, thus effectively improving the traceability accuracy of product processing.

AB  - Crop Yield Analysis and Prediction is a fast-expanding discipline that is critical for optimizing agricultural methods. A lack of trustworthy data is one of the challenges in estimating crop yields. We develop predictive models for 22 different fruits and vegetables data. The goals of this study are to create accurate and interpretable crop recommendation models. We used multiple machine learning (ML) models for multi-class crop production prediction to fulfill our research goal. We thoroughly examined the influence of climate and nutrient factors on crop yield, considering their complex interactions. To improve the dataset, augmented data techniques were applied. Configuring the parameters and fine-tuning the hyperparameters is our technique to increase the model performance. Furthermore, we employ explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques and interpretability tools like Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to improve the interpretability of our prediction model. Our findings reveal that the XGBoost model has the best performance model with 99.86% accuracy, followed by SVM Poly Kernel with 99.32% and Random Forest with 98.82%. Feature selection and analysis are emphasized, particularly in regional agricultural contexts. This study contributes to the creation of accurate and interpretable crop recommendation models while also addressing the issue of untrustworthy data, providing useful insights for optimizing agricultural practices. © 2023 IEEE.

TI  - A Procedure for Tracing Supply Chains for Perishable Food Based on Blockchain, Machine Learning and Fuzzy Logic
AU  - Shahbazi, Z

T2  - ELECTRONICS
AB  - One of the essential points of food manufacturing in the industry and shelf life of the products is to improve the food traceability system. In recent years, the food traceability mechanism has become one of the emerging blockchain applications in order to improve the anti-counterfeiting area's quality. Many food manufacturing systems have a low level of readability, scalability, and data accuracy. Similarly, this process is complicated in the supply chain and needs a lot of time for processing. The blockchain system creates a new ontology in the traceability system supply chain to deal with these issues. In this paper, a blockchain machine learning-based food traceability system (BMLFTS) is proposed in order to combine the new extension in blockchain, Machine Learning technology (ML), and fuzzy logic traceability system that is based on the shelf life management system for manipulating perishable food. The blockchain technology in the proposed system has been developed in order to address light-weight, evaporation, warehouse transactions, or shipping time. The blockchain data flow is designed to show the extension of ML at the level of food traceability. Finally, reliable and accurate data are used in a supply chain to improve shelf life.

T2  - 2021 8th International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development (INDIACom)
AB  - In agrosystems, the soil plays a determining role through the multitude of ecosystem services that it provides. Agriculture exploits natural spaces and resources for useful production to humans. Soil is the primary source of nutrients for the plants. The roots absorb nutrient ions from soil and water. Additional nutrients must be mixed in the soil before the cultivation begins. Use of excess chemicals has adverse effects both on the crop and the environment. Optimal amount of nutrient requirement must be met for maximum yield. This paper presents a crop selection criteria based on K-nearest neighbour algorithm. The proposed method used farm inputs like soil type, climate, micronutrients, macronutrients, water source etc. to select the best crop suited for the farm. The algorithm also provides the amount of deficient nutrients required for the crop production. This methodology can be integrated into a semantic interoperability framework for Internet of Things (IoT) based applications. The proposed method accurately estimated the crop needs and the corresponding quantity of the nutrient necessary and sufficient to achieve a production objective defined by the yield.

AB  - Food traceability has been one of the emerging blockchain applications in recent years, for improving the areas of anti-counterfeiting and quality assurance. Existing food traceability systems do not guarantee a high level of system reliability, scalability, and information accuracy. Moreover, the traceability process is time-consuming and complicated in modern supply chain networks. To alleviate these concerns, blockchain technology is promising to create a new ontology for supply chain traceability. However, most consensus mechanisms and data flow in blockchain are developed for cryptocurrency, not for supply chain traceability; hence, simply applying blockchain technology to food traceability is impractical. In this paper, a blockchain-IoT-based food traceability system (BIFTS) is proposed to integrate the novel deployment of blockchain, IoT technology, and fuzzy logic into a total traceability shelf life management system for managing perishable food. To address the needs for food traceability, lightweight and vaporized characteristics are deployed in the blockchain, while an integrated consensus mechanism that considers shipment transit time, stakeholder assessment, and shipment volume is developed. The data flow of blockchain is then aligned to the deployment of IoT technologies according to the level of traceable resource units. Subsequently, the decision support can be established in the food supply chain by using reliable and accurate data for shelf life adjustment, and by using fuzzy logic for quality decay evaluation.

AB  - The definition and representation on the model base's descriptions are the basis of reuse, integration and management of heterogeneous model resources. The study proposed the organization method of the agriculture model components based on topic maps. On the basis of the meta-modeling techniques and the topic map techniques, the study comprehensively analyzed the agricultural model characteristics, extracted the model component facets and its associated descriptions, and established the agricultural model component library's description model (DM-AMCL). Then, it hierarchically mapped and annotated the model component semantic and syntactic information by using the topic map. We designed the organization framework of the agriculture model components library on topic maps (TM-AMCL). For example of wheat development model, the XTM document instance is build. The result shows that, converting the agriculture models base to TM-AMCL can provide a unified descriptions and access to data for the intelligent decision support system developers, the managers of agriculture model and the computer system. © 2011 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.

AB  - Nowadays, having an Internet of Things based systems is a challenge in the Agrifood Value Chain. The main goal of these systems is to ensure traceability and transparency to all supply chain actors starting from producer and until final consumer. To achieve this goal several aspects must be taken in consideration: information coming from sensors, information needed and produced by business process involved in the supply chain, overlap of these two type of information in order to better manage them. This paper proposes a framework able to manage these aspects both from methodological and from technological point of view.

T2  - 2012 IEEE 14th International Conference on e-Health Networking, Applications and Services (Healthcom)
AB  - The long-term maintenance of electronic health records within their original context of information is an ethical requirement that conflicts with the constant need to migrate the information into new systems as they are developed and improved. The specifics of every particular healthcare setting preclude the feasibility of a monolithic health record, and the achievement of interoperability between systems is the primary challenge faced by health informatics researchers. Different multilevel modeling approaches have been studied to deal with this complexity. Nevertheless, the original multilevel modeling specifications are targeted to the development of hospital-based electronic medical records, which adds complexity to the development of simpler purpose-specific applications for extra-hospital healthcare situations. This paper presents the knowledge engineering of a minimalist multilevel model that can be implemented by developers across the broader spectrum of healthcare applications. By using industry standard technologies, this approach enables the wider adoption of interoperable technology for healthcare.

AB  - Open data analysis platforms are being adopted to support collaboration in science and business. Studies suggest that analytic work in an enterprise occurs in a complex ecosystem of people, data, and software working in a coordinated manner. These studies also point to friction between the elements of this ecosystem that reduces user productivity and quality of work. LabBook is an open, social, and collaborative data analysis platform designed explicitly to reduce this friction and accelerate discovery. Its goal is to help users leverage each other's knowledge and experience to find the data, tools and collaborators they need to integrate, visualize, and analyze data. The key insight is to collect and use more metadata about all elements of the analytic ecosystem by means of an architecture and user experience that reduce the cost of contributing such metadata. We demonstrate how metadata can be exploited to improve the collaborative user experience and facilitate collaborative data integration and recommendations. We describe a specific use case and discuss several design issues concerning the capture, representation, querying and use of metadata.

T2  - ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN AGRICULTURE
AB  - Deep learning and computer vision techniques have gained significant attention in the agriculture sector due to their non-destructive and contactless features. These techniques are also being integrated into modern farming systems, such as aquaponics, to address the challenges hindering its commercialization and large-scale implementation. Aquaponics is a farming technology that combines a recirculating aquaculture system and soilless hydroponics agriculture, that promises to address food security issues. To complement the current research efforts, a methodology is proposed to automatically measure the morphological traits of crops such as width, length and area and estimate the effective plant spacing between grow channels. Plant spacing is one of the key design parameters that are dependent on crop type and its morphological traits and hence needs to be monitored to ensure high crop yield and quality which can be impacted due to foliage occlusion or overlapping as the crop grows. The proposed approach uses Mask-RCNN to estimate the size of the crops and a mathematical model to determine plant spacing for a self-adaptive aquaponics farm. For common little gem romaine lettuce, the growth is estimated within 2 cm of error for both length and width. The final model is deployed on a cloud-based application and integrated with an ontology model containing domain knowledge of the aquaponics system. The relevant knowledge about crop characteristics and optimal plant spacing is extracted from ontology and compared with results obtained from the final model to suggest further actions. The proposed application finds its significance as a decision support system that can pave the way for intelligent system monitoring and control.& COPY; 2023 The Authors.

AB  - The increase of the adoption of IoT devices and the contemporary problem of food production have given rise to numerous applications of IoT in agriculture. These applications typically comprise a set of sensors that are installed in open fields and measure metrics, such as temperature or humidity, which are used for irrigation control systems. Though useful, most contemporary systems have high installation and maintenance costs, and they do not offer automated control or, if they do, they are usually not interpretable, and thus cannot be trusted for such critical applications. In this work, we design Vital, a system that incorporates a set of low-cost sensors, a robust data store, and most importantly an explainable AI decision support system. Our system outputs a fuzzy rule-base, which is interpretable and allows fully automating the irrigation of the fields. Upon evaluating Vital in two pilot cases, we conclude that it can be effective for monitoring open-field installations. © 2020, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.

AB  - In the era of mass agriculture to keep up with the increasing demand for food production, advanced monitoring systems are required in order to handle several challenges such as perishable products, food waste, unpredictable supply variations and stringent food safety and sustainability requirements. The evolution of Internet of Things have provided means for collecting, processing, and communicating data associated with agricultural processes. This have opened several opportunities to sustain, improve productivity and reduce waste in every step in the food supply chain system. On the hand, this resulted in several new challenges, such as, the security of the data, recording and representation of data, providing real time control, reliability of the system, and dealing with big data. This paper proposes an architecture for security of big data in the agricultural supply chain management system. This can help in reducing food waste, increasing the reliability of the supply chain, and enhance the performance of the food supply chain system.

AU  - Rang, R

T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - Traditional recommendation systems usually use single user-item interaction information, which ignore the multiple relationships that exist for other interactions (e.g., likes, clicks). Multi-behavioral recommendation models compensate for the shortcomings of traditional models. The existing multi-behavior recommendation models focus on obtaining behavioral information by distinguishing the interaction differences of multiple user behaviors but ignore the common preferences of items related to user different interactions. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Behavior Heterogeneous Contrastive learning Recommendation (MBHCR) model. Specifically, MBHCR stresses the information fusion between different interaction behaviors and differences in the behavior view. Firstly, we design a unified heterogeneous graph based on the complexity of user multi-behavioral interaction information to distinguish behavioral differences while preserving their complete semantic information. Secondly, we propose a multi-behavior relational aggregator component to model the unified heterogeneous graph only once to capture the potential common representations of users and their different interactions and to mitigate user sparsity. Thirdly, we also design a behavior comparison learning enhancer to complement the interaction differences between the user's target behavior and auxiliary behaviors on the behavior view and extract valid information. Experiments were conducted on two real-world datasets to demonstrate the validity of MBHCR and designed ablation experiments to verify the contribution of model components.

AB  - Traditional recommendation systems model user preferences based on past historical behaviors, thus unable to obtain dynamic user preferences. The conversational recommendation system (CRS) combines the conversational module with the recommendation module and overcomes the limitations by directly asking the user's preference for attributes. However, the existing CRS methods lack effective information propagation among various modules, making the model lack the basis for making correct decisions. In this paper, we propose an Employer-Employee network, which decomposes the actions into two stages, which are completed by two networks respectively. The Employer Network is responsible for analyzing information and making decisions (query or recommend), and the Employee Network is responsible for collecting information and performing tasks. Our contributions can be highlighted in three aspects: We first emphasize the importance of information propagation among multiple modules in the conversational recommendation system. Secondly, we propose an Employer-Employee (EE) network, which transforms each turn of action into a two-stage decision-making task handed over to two networks to complete. Thirdly, we conduct experiments on multiple datasets, and the experimental results show that our model achieves competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

AB  - The Uncertainty Representation and Reasoning Evaluation Framework (URREF) ontology addresses various semantic ambiguities associated with uncertainty. One of the main objectives of the URREF ontology is to define and articulate the criteria which enable the systematic reasoning about and evaluation of uncertainty representation and reasoning in information fusion systems. Towards assessing the merits of the URREF, information quality requires close attention for the measuring veracity and relevance. Veracity is measured from source sensitivity. Relevance is determined from precision and recall measures which are added to the URREF ontology. An example based on the Avionics Analytics Ontology (AAO) for Air Traffic Management with multiple Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) radars is provided. The use or the precision-recall, F1 score, and sensitivity provide useful analysis for semantically important discussions on “relevance” as a complement of “recall” in information fusion uncertainty assessment.

AB  - Emotion recognition serves as one of the key research areas as Facebook use on web. On instagram, Google, Wikipedia, as well as others, individuals share their views, ideas, emotions, feelings, and views, bringing a considerable measure with fire to modern life. Ai, sometimes referred to as recommender systems, focuses on categorizing and predicting men’s sentiments regarding that same issue. It is sometimes referred to as “emotional ore” or “mood coal.” It involves classifying written texts into pro or con groups depending on the stated viewpoint on a particular problem. Despite the simple fact that recommendation system may seem to be similar to text categorization, it faces a variety of issues which has inspired much study in this field. To improve the tone study, many automation (ML) and also dictionary strategies were created in the story. In this work, we just provide results of an university level that aims to assess the state of the science. In order for new called electronic to be developed by researchers in the future who have more information and can address in all issues and get the best outcomes.

AB  - Food traceability has been one of the emerging blockchain applications in recent years, for improving the areas of anti-counterfeiting and quality assurance. Existing food traceability systems do not guarantee a high level of system reliability, scalability, and information accuracy. Moreover, the traceability process is time-consuming and complicated in modern supply chain networks. To alleviate these concerns, blockchain technology is promising to create a new ontology for supply chain traceability. However, most consensus mechanisms and data flow in blockchain are developed for cryptocurrency, not for supply chain traceability; hence, simply applying blockchain technology to food traceability is impractical. In this paper, a blockchain-IoT-based food traceability system (BIFTS) is proposed to integrate the novel deployment of blockchain, IoT technology, and fuzzy logic into a total traceability shelf life management system for managing perishable food. To address the needs for food traceability, lightweight and vaporized characteristics are deployed in the blockchain, while an integrated consensus mechanism that considers shipment transit time, stakeholder assessment, and shipment volume is developed. The data flow of blockchain is then aligned to the deployment of IoT technologies according to the level of traceable resource units. Subsequently, the decision support can be established in the food supply chain by using reliable and accurate data for shelf life adjustment, and by using fuzzy logic for quality decay evaluation. © 2013 IEEE.

TI  - Fuzzy Cognitive Maps: Their Role in Explainable Artificial Intelligence
AU  - Apostolopoulos, I.D.

T2  - Applied Sciences (Switzerland)
AB  - Currently, artificial intelligence is facing several problems with its practical implementation in various application domains. The explainability of advanced artificial intelligence algorithms is a topic of paramount importance, and many discussions have been held recently. Pioneering and classical machine learning and deep learning models behave as black boxes, constraining the logical interpretations that the end users desire. Artificial intelligence applications in industry, medicine, agriculture, and social sciences require the users’ trust in the systems. Users are always entitled to know why and how each method has made a decision and which factors play a critical role. Otherwise, they will always be wary of using new techniques. This paper discusses the nature of fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs), a soft computational method to model human knowledge and provide decisions handling uncertainty. Though FCMs are not new to the field, they are evolving and incorporate recent advancements in artificial intelligence, such as learning algorithms and convolutional neural networks. The nature of FCMs reveals their supremacy in transparency, interpretability, transferability, and other aspects of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods. The present study aims to reveal and defend the explainability properties of FCMs and to highlight their successful implementation in many domains. Subsequently, the present study discusses how FCMs cope with XAI directions and presents critical examples from the literature that demonstrate their superiority. The study results demonstrate that FCMs are both in accordance with the XAI directives and have many successful applications in domains such as medical decision-support systems, precision agriculture, energy savings, environmental monitoring, and policy-making for the public sector. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Given the current economic situation and the financial crisis in many European countries, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) have found internationalisation and exportation of their products as the main way out of this crisis. In this paper, we provide a decision support system that semantically aggregates information from many heterogeneous web resources and provides guidance to SMEs for their potential investments. The main contributions of this paper are the introduction of SME internationalisation indicators that can be considered for such decisions, as well as the novel decision support system for SME internationalisation based on inference over semantically integrated data from heterogeneous web resources. The system is evaluated by SME experts in realistic scenarios in the section of dairy products.

TI  - Traceability Models and Traceability Systems to Accelerate the Transition to a Circular Economy: A Systematic Review
AU  - Santana, S

T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Research and implementation efforts and investment in the circular economy are rising sharply. With the high stakes associated with achievements in the field, an increasing emphasis on evaluation, transparency and accountability are to be expected. All require high-quality data, methodologies and tools that are able to improve results and to assess and document the implementation processes and outcomes. A challenging key issue in the implementation of a circular economy is ensuring coordination, control and transparency within a network of parties. Traceability models and systems are vital pillars of such an endeavor, but a preliminary search of the available literature revealed a rather unstable and fragmented research field and practice. The objective of this systematic review was to examine those studies discussing traceability models and traceability systems while connecting traceability capacities and outputs to implement the principles of the circular economy. The literature databases were searched on 6 January 2020, with an update for the entire year of 2020. Overall, 49 studies were included. By addressing eight specific research questions, we found that a link between traceability and the circular economy is yet to be established. Sound research and practice documentation are required to establish evidence regarding this connection, including methodologies that are able to support the design and implementation of business- and lifecycle-oriented, value-based traceability models and traceability systems, along with thorough evaluation methods and tools incorporating economic, social and environmental perspectives.

AB  - Industry 4.0 applications help digital industrial transformation to be achieved through smart, data-driven solutions that improve production efficiency, product consistency, preventive maintenance, and the logistics of industrial applications and related supply chains. To enable and accelerate digital industrial transformation, it is vital to support cost-efficient Industry 4.0 application development. However, the development of such Industry 4.0 applications is currently expensive due to the limitations of existing IoT platforms in representing complex industrial machines, the support of only production line-based application testing, and the lack of cost models for application cost/benefit analysis. In this paper, we propose the use of Cyber Twins (CTs), an extension of Digital Twins, to support cost-efficient Industry 4.0 application development. CTs provide semantic descriptions of the machines they represent and incorporate machine simulators that enable application testing without any production line risk and cost. This paper focuses on CT-based Industry 4.0 application development and the related cost models. Via a case study of a CT-based Industry 4.0 application from the dairy industry, the paper shows that CT-based Industry 4.0 applications can be developed with approximately 60% of the cost of IoT platform-based application development. © by the authors.

This raises the need for increasing stakeholders' knowledge of the food production process and adopting data sharing practices in the product and supply chain management. Data sharing platforms can undertake the role of creating high value from data while facilitating secure and mutually beneficial multi-partner data sharing. Our proposed system aims to deliver an industrial data platform that will facilitate the exchange and connection of data between different food safety actors, who are interested in sharing information critical to certification, while boosting the way that food certification takes place in Europe.

T2  - Journal of Big Data
AB  - Precision agriculture in the realm of the Internet of Things is characterized by the collection of data from multiple sensors deployed on the farm. These data present a spatial, temporal, and semantic characterization, which further complicates the performance in the management and implementation of models and repositories. In turn, the lack of standards is reflected in insufficient interoperability between management solutions and other non-native services in the framework. In this paper, an innovative system for spatio-temporal semantic data management is proposed. It includes a data query system that allows farmers and users to solve queries daily, as well as feed decision-making, monitoring, and task automation solutions. In the proposal, a solution is provided to ensure service interoperability and is validated against two European smart farming platforms, namely AFarCloud and DEMETER. For the evaluation and validation of the proposed framework, a neural network is implemented, fed through STSDaMaS for training and validation, to provide accurate forecasts for the harvest and baling of forage legume crops for livestock feeding. As a result of the evaluation for the training and execution of neural networks, high performance on complex spatio-temporal semantic queries is exposed. The paper concludes with a distributed framework for managing complex spatio-temporal semantic data by offering service interoperability through data integration to external agricultural data models.

T2  - Computers and Electronics in Agriculture
AB  - Mathematical programming models are invaluable tools at decision making, assisting managers to uncover otherwise unattainable means to optimize their processes. However, the value they provide is only as good as their capacity to capture the process domain. This information can only be obtained from stakeholders, i.e., clients or users, who can hardly communicate the requirements clearly and completely. Besides, existing conceptual models of mathematical programming models are not standardized, nor is the process of deriving the mathematical programming model from the concept model, which remains ad hoc. In this paper, we propose an agile methodology to construct mathematical programming models based on two techniques from requirements engineering that have been proven effective at requirements elicitation: the language extended lexicon (LEL) and scenarios. Using the pair of LEL + scenarios allows to create a conceptual model that is clear and complete enough to derive a mathematical programming model that effectively captures the business domain. We also define an ontology to describe the pair LEL + scenarios, which has been implemented with a semantic mediawiki and allows the collaborative construction of the conceptual model and the semi-automatic derivation of mathematical programming model elements. The process is applied and validated in a known fresh tomato packing optimization problem. This proposal can be of high relevance for the development and implementation of mathematical programming models for optimizing agriculture and supply chain management related processes in order to fill the current gap between mathematical programming models in the theory and the practice. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Driven by the rapid growth of multimedia big data, multimodal learning (especially multimodal deep learning) has gained its significant importance and achieved biggest success in various multimedia computing related applications. The complexity and scale of modern multimedia recommender system often require much more sophisticated statistical model, learning architecture and data processing algorithms to facilitate effective and efficient content understanding and analysis than ever before. In this work, we discuss several major research challenges of the future multimedia recommender system supported by advanced multimodal learning. We also, 1) introduce why multimodal learning is important for large scale multimedia recommendation, 2) review various limitations of the current generation of learning model and architecture, and 3) review key challenges and technical issues in developing and evaluating modern multimedia recommender systems with multimodal learning under different contexts. We hope that our discussion and prediction provide an impetus for further research on this important direction.

AB  - Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is a growing public and veterinary health concern, and the ability to accurately predict AMR from antibiotics administration data is crucial for effectively treating and managing infections. While genomics-based approaches can provide better results, sequencing, assembling, and applying Machine Learning (ML) methods can take several hours. Therefore, alternative approaches are required. This study focused on using ML for antimicrobial stewardship by utilising data extracted from hospital electronic health records, which can be done in real-time, and developing an interpretable 1D-Transformer model for predicting AMR. A multi-baseline Integrated Gradient pipeline was also incorporated to interpret the model, and quantitative validation metrics were introduced to validate the model. The performance of the proposed 1D-Transformer model was evaluated using a dataset of urinary tract infection (UTI) patients with four antibiotics. The proposed 1D-Transformer model achieved 10% higher area under curve (AUC) in predicting AMR and outperformed traditional ML models. The Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) pipeline also provided interpretable results, identifying the signatures contributing to the predictions. This could be used as a decision support tool for personalised treatment, introducing AMR-aware food and management of AMR, and it could also be used to identify signatures for targeted interventions.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Established approaches to assuring safety-critical systems and software are difficult to apply to systems employing ML where there is no clear, pre-defined specification against which to assess validity. This problem is exacerbated by the “opaque” nature of ML where the learnt model is not amenable to human scrutiny. Explainable AI (XAI) methods have been proposed to tackle this issue by producing human-interpretable representations of ML models which can help users to gain confidence and build trust in the ML system. However, little work explicitly investigates the role of explainability for safety assurance in the context of ML development. This paper identifies ways in which XAI methods can contribute to safety assurance of ML-based systems. It then uses a concrete ML-based clinical decision support system, concerning weaning of patients from mechanical ventilation, to demonstrate how XAI methods can be employed to produce evidence to support safety assurance. The results are also represented in a safety argument to show where, and in what way, XAI methods can contribute to a safety case. Overall, we conclude that XAI methods have a valuable role in safety assurance of ML-based systems in healthcare but that they are not sufficient in themselves to assure safety.

T2  - IEEE Access
AB  - Security and privacy are among the key barriers to adopting the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) solutions. IoMT adopters have to adhere to security and privacy policies to ensure that patient data remains confidential and secure. However, there is confusion among IoMT stakeholders as to what security measures they should expect from the IoMT manufacturers and whether these measures would comply with the adopter's security and compliance requirements. In this paper, we present a recommendation tool that models IoMT concepts and security issues in addition to successively recommending security measures. The presented tool utilizes semantically enriched ontology to model the IoMT components, security issues, and measures. The developed ontology is equipped with context-aware rules to enable reasoning in order to build a recommendation system that empowers users to make well-educated decisions. The recommendation tool classifies IoMT security threats faced by IoMT stakeholders and automatically recommends security controls that have to be enforced for each threat. We have experimented the proposed tool with respect to the completeness and effectiveness of its output (i.e., security issues and recommended security measures). The results show that the tool was effectively able to recommend necessary security measures.

AB  - This article focuses on the food supply chain and aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal of Zero Hunger. They are looking to avoid food waste where Smart Cities must work. Food waste requires innovation with technology to change consumer's behaviors, efficient supply chain management, and innovative food production systems not to harm the environment. Among the economic impact, water and carbon footprint affects vital performance indicators into a Smart City. Hence, this work considers water and carbon footprint, as well as economic impact. We contribute to the Smart Cities, providing a multi-Agent simulation able to be scaled with an ontology with the purpose to plot different scenarios to stakeholders in a Smart City and help to avoid food waste situations. To simplify the simulation, as preliminary work, we used a typical food in Guadalajara Metropolitan Area, which is a Taco. The model covers a community in the Zapopan Municipality, where a developed urban study is the first proof of the system's concept. Furthermore, based on the simulation scenarios fed with real, local data, we discussed how we can integrate this multi-agent platform to face COVID-19. Finally, we want to help family businesses on the food supply chain using information technologies and applying digital processes to better adapt to new operation rules since COVID-19 to fight food waste since COVID-19.  © 2020 IEEE.

T2  - Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing
AB  - Food supply chain networks are characterized by clouds of various partners providing required products or services to meet customer demands. The coordination of the SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprise) is a major challenge that food chain networks are facing. Delivering the right information to partners and providing semantic interoperability play key roles in effective coordination. This paper proposes an efficient framework to help these SMEs to easily negotiate and shape the profiles of the traceability information products. It tries to involve various tools to model the contexts of SMEs, and then adopt the concepts of mass customization to suggest optimal profiles for the desired information. In supply chain level, agents and governance boarders are supposed to negotiate and determine the profiles of needed information products. The customized information profiles are then employed to map and integrate various information sources to produce the required information products. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

T2  - 2021 IEEE Electrical Power and Energy Conference (EPEC)
AB  - Photovoltaic (PV) systems produce less energy when operating under shadings. PV planners need to identify important factors affecting the shadings to forecast power generations in various ambient conditions. Using a case study, we show that overlooking the impact of an environmental factor, herein snowfalls, will result in overestimations in the power forecasting. In this paper, we study the context of the shading from different perspectives and introduce parameters that can affect the duration and severity of shading conditions. To identify key notions of the shading and important factors involved, we implement a literature review and include experts’ knowledge by exploring PV planning tools and conducting a survey in the sector of solar energy. The identified factors can be used to develop a knowledge-based model representing key concepts associated with shading conditions. In addition, the identification of important factors affecting the duration and severity of shading conditions addresses new research domains that need to be explored in the field of PV shading and power estimation.

AB  - A conceptual ontological model of Digital Crime has been developed, consisting of five non-empty classes. Identification and classification were carried out according to the experience of domestic and foreign experts. The central place of the model is occupied by objects of the Digital Crime class, which have their own attributes and are connected by various links with other objects. Objects of some classes are filled in by users, others are formed by knowledge engineers. Based on the ontological analysis, SWRL-rules are constructed that automatically form links between objects of the custom classes Digital crime and Digital evidence with objects of the Type of crime and Criminal Liability classes. The last class contains articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine on criminal liability for digital crimes. The ontological model is developed taking into account possible requests to it. Such queries can be formed on the basis of direct relationships between human and automatic concepts. And also contain logical chains to concepts that do not contain an explicit link in the ontology. It is assumed that the model can be expanded and supplemented. The ontological model of Digital Crime can be used to share information, develop new systems and applications, improve information retrieval and ensure its accordance.

AB  - Since the mid-1990s, there has been a growing interest among consumers and producers in downscaling to a local level the length of the agri-food chains as a solution for fairer and more sustainable food production systems. From the point of view of consumption, the attribute "local" is assuming an important role in defining food purchasing preferences, both in terms of expectations of product quality and in terms of its perceived relevance in determining the supply chain sustainability. This research aims to define how individuals' perception of local production influences the definition of "local" among consumers based on a survey submitted to a sample of 500 consumers in North-Western Italy. The paper provides: (i) a semantic map built on keywords adopted by the respondents to describe local production; (ii) a categorization of food consumers divided in clusters on the basis of their eating styles; and (iii) a characterization of consumers clusters according to the preferences and knowledge expressed towards local production. The results show that consumers' awareness and attitudes towards the concept of the "local" are influenced by the joint effect of their socio-demographic profile and their food consumption style, with some unexpected evidences that would deserve to be deepen with further research. However, given this uncertainty, three main traits seem to characterize the consumers attitude towards the "local": a positive relation among the dimensions of environment, local development and product quality and the strength of the link between local production and the reduction of the length of the supply chain. Ultimately, territoriality is perceived as an index of higher product quality (seasonal, therefore fresh and genuine).

AB  - Model-based assessment of the potential impacts of variables on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) can bring great additional information about possible policy intervention points. In the context of sustainability planning, machine learning techniques can provide data-driven solutions throughout the modeling life cycle. In a changing environment, existing models must be continuously reviewed and developed for effective decision support. Thus, we propose to use the Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) life cycle framework. A novel approach for model identification and development is introduced, which involves utilizing the Shapley value to determine the individual direct and indirect contributions of each variable towards the output, as well as network analysis to identify key drivers and support the identification and validation of possible policy intervention points. The applicability of the methods is demonstrated through a case study of the Hungarian water model developed by the Global Green Growth Institute. Based on the model exploration of the case of water efficiency and water stress (in the examined period for the SDG 6.4.1 & 6.4.2) SDG indicators, water reuse and water circularity offer a more effective intervention option than pricing and the use of internal or external renewable water resources.  © 2024 Ipkovich et al.

AB  - COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) is a pandemic which has been spreading exponentially around the globe. Many countries had adopted stay-at-home or lockdown policies to control its spreading. However, prolonged stay-at-home can cause worse effects like economic crises, unemployment, food scarcity, and mental health problems of individuals. EasyBand2.0 is a wearable personal safety device that helps in social distancing and also helps in safe mobility. Under the IoMT (Internet of Medical Things) framework the wearable EasyBand2.0 device helps in social distancing, it avoids human-to-human contact and helps maintain a safer distance. EasyBand2.0 uses the Low Power BLE technology to sense distance between two user devices and alert them based on the distance and time spent in proximity. Safe mobility of people is also important as travel is resumed in all forms. This paper proposes a software application along with the easy band to further be integrated with a system that works based on GPS (Global Positioning System) or GIS (Geographic Information System) to provide travel logging for contact tracing without exposing personal data. A CARS (Context Aware Recommendation System) based safe zone recommender system is proposed in this paper to aid safe mobility.

AB  - Cross-modal retrieval for rice leaf diseases is crucial for prevention, providing agricultural experts with data-driven decision support to address disease threats and safeguard rice production. To overcome the limitations of current crop leaf disease retrieval frameworks, we focused on four common rice leaf diseases and established the first cross-modal rice leaf disease retrieval dataset (CRLDRD). We introduced cross-modal retrieval to the domain of rice leaf disease retrieval and introduced FHTW-Net, a framework for rice leaf disease image–text retrieval. To address the challenge of matching diverse image categories with complex text descriptions during the retrieval process, we initially employed ViT and BERT to extract fine-grained image and text feature sequences enriched with contextual information. Subsequently, two-way mixed self-attention (TMS) was introduced to enhance both image and text feature sequences, with the aim of uncovering important semantic information in both modalities. Then, we developed false-negative elimination–hard negative mining (FNE-HNM) strategy to facilitate in-depth exploration of semantic connections between different modalities. This strategy aids in selecting challenging negative samples for elimination to constrain the model within the triplet loss function. Finally, we introduced warm-up bat algorithm (WBA) for learning rate optimization, which improves the model’s convergence speed and accuracy. Experimental results demonstrated that FHTW-Net outperforms state-of-the-art models. In image-to-text retrieval, it achieved R@1, R@5, and R@10 accuracies of 83.5%, 92%, and 94%, respectively, while in text-to-image retrieval, it achieved accuracies of 82.5%, 98%, and 98.5%, respectively. FHTW-Net offers advanced technical support and algorithmic guidance for cross-modal retrieval of rice leaf diseases. © 2024 Hongliang Zhou et al. Exclusive licensee Nanjing Agricultural University.

AB  - E-learning sites are useful for improving the skills and awareness of the academic backbone, such as instructors, students, administrative staff, and those who are searching for current information about var-ious educational institutes. Despite all the benefits of an online learning platform, users face some chal-lenges and complexities, such as selecting appropriate learning material and courses based on their needs and preferences. Hence, the provision of quality resources during the training phases is their central responsibility, the lack of online assistance offered by service providers is known to be the key cause of many difficulties. There is a need to create a system that can intelligently propose courses while con-sidering a variety of viewpoints to enhance the learners' skills and knowledge. This research proposes an architecture that builds semantic recommendations with the aid of virtual agents based on user require-ments and preferences, assisting academia in seeking appropriate courses in a real-world setting. The experimental and statistical results show that, when compared with existing techniques, the virtualized agent-based recommendation system not only improved user learning skills but also made course selec-tion easier, depending on users' interests and preferences.

AB  - Extensive use of herbicides for weed management poses a major threat to the environment and food supply chain. The extent weeds take away the resources of the crop desired depends on the nature of the soil along with the type of the crop grown. Artificial intelligence enabled technologies are replacing human involvement in either removing the weed or targeted spray of the herbicides. However, the highest degree of similarity between weed and the desired crop as well as the existence of wide range of weeds affect the classification accuracy. Lack of ample labelled data is another problem there by affecting the overall problem of weed detection. These issues can be addressed by pooling up larger datasets under different conditions followed by making use of relevant advanced algorithms. Current work proposes a multi-layeredCNN model for identifying the weeds in Capsicum Annuum (Chilli) particularly in red sandy fields. The crop dataset was acquired under different growth stages of the crop and fed to the model along with different varieties of weed data set. Promising results were obtained with an accuracy of 99.92% within lesser number of epochs.

AB  - Quantifying the resilience in the food system is important for food security issues. In this work, we present a geospatial knowledge graph (GeoKG)-based method for measuring the resilience of a multi-commodity flow network. Specifically, we develop a CFS-GeoKG ontology to describe geospatial semantics of a multi-commodity flow network comprehensively, and design resilience metrics that measure the node-level and network-level dependence of single-sourcing, distant, or non-adjacent suppliers/customers in food supply chains. We conduct a case study of the US state-level agricultural multi-commodity flow network with hierarchical commodity types. The results indicate that, by leveraging GeoKG, our method supports measuring both node-level and network-level resilience across space and over time and also helps discover concentration patterns of agricultural resources in the spatial network at different geographic scales.  © 2022 ACM.

TI  - Food waste matters - A systematic review of household food waste practices and their policy implications
AU  - Schanes, K.

T2  - Journal of Cleaner Production
AB  - In recent years, food waste has received growing interest from local, national and European policymakers, international organisations, NGOs as well as academics from various disciplinary fields. Increasing concerns about food security and environmental impacts, such as resource depletion and greenhouse gas emissions attributed to food waste, have intensified attention to the topic. While food waste occurs in all stages of the food supply chain, private households have been identified as key actors in food waste generation. However, the evidence on why food waste occurs remains scattered. This paper maps the still small but expanding academic territory of consumer food waste by systematically reviewing empirical studies on food waste practices as well as distilling factors that foster and impede the generation of food waste on the household level. Moreover, we briefly discuss the contributions of different social ontologies, more particularly psychology-related approaches and social practice theory. The analysis reveals food waste as a complex and multi-faceted issue that cannot be attributed to single variables; this also calls for a stronger integration of different disciplinary perspectives. Mapping the determinants of waste generation deepens the understanding of household practices and helps design food waste prevention strategies. Finally, we link the identified factors with a set of policy, business, and retailer options. © 2018 The Authors

TI  - ABVE-Construct: An agent-based virtual entreprise model for civil engineering
AU  - Oprea, M.
T2  - Scalable Computing
AB  - Modelling efficient virtual enterprises (VEs) represents a real challenge in the context of dynamic, complex and extending business markets. Among the modelling approaches proposed for VEs, multi-agent systems are more suitable due to their basic characteristics of flexibility, modularity, distributivity as well as some characteristics such as adaptability and learning, that could be added in order to improve the overall VE performance and scalability. The application of VEs and agent-based VEs were proposed for several industrial domains: automotive industry, food industry, electronics and telecommunications, transportation, robotics, for manufacturing and supply chain problems solving. This paper presents a generic framework for virtual enterprises development, VE-Frame, and an agent-based virtual enterprise model, ABVE-Construct, for the civil engineering domain, derived from the VE-Frame. Also, a case study of using the model for a building construction scenario, and the model adaptation options for other domains of applications are discussed. © 2014 SCPE.

AB  - The surge in global population is compelling a shift toward smart agriculture practices. This coupled with the diminishing natural resources, limited availability of arable land, increase in unpredictable weather conditions makes food security a major concern for most countries. As a result, the use of Internet of Things (IoT) and data analytics (DA) are employed to enhance the operational efficiency and productivity in the agriculture sector. There is a paradigm shift from use of wireless sensor network (WSN) as a major driver of smart agriculture to the use of IoT and DA. The IoT integrates several existing technologies, such as WSN, radio frequency identification, cloud computing, middleware systems, and end-user applications. In this paper, several benefits and challenges of IoT have been identified. We present the IoT ecosystem and how the combination of IoT and DA is enabling smart agriculture. Furthermore, we provide future trends and opportunities which are categorized into technological innovations, application scenarios, business, and marketability.

AB  - Conventional multimedia recommender systems treat multimedia as a passive file that plays no role in the computation. In this paper we introduce the concept of Smart multimedia at which the knowledge and the computation required to solve the recommendation problem is transferred to the multimedia itself. Hence, converting the multimedia into an autonomous computational entity that performs its own computation and is responsible for its own decisions concerning where it should be displayed. Our approach utilizes content-based recommendation, where the internal content semantics are captured through semantic level intelligence. Hence, it is very suitable to be used in personalized advertisements.

AB  - Assessing crop production in the field often requires breeders to wait until the end of the season to collect yield-related measurements, limiting the pace of the breeding cycle. Early prediction of crop performance can reduce this constraint by allowing breeders more time to focus on the highest-performing varieties. Here, we present a multimodal deep learning model for predicting the performance of maize (Zea mays) at an early developmental stage, offering the potential to accelerate crop breeding. We employed multispectral images and eight vegetation indices, collected by an uncrewed aerial vehicle approximately 60 days after sowing, over three consecutive growing cycles (2017, 2018 and 2019). The multimodal deep learning approach was used to integrate field management and genotype information with the multispectral data, providing context to the conditions that the plants experienced during the trial. Model performance was assessed using holdout data, in which the model accurately predicted the yield (RMSE 1.07 t/ha, a relative RMSE of 7.60% of 16 t/ha, and R2 score 0.73) and identified the majority of high-yielding varieties, outperforming previously published models for early yield prediction. The inclusion of vegetation indices was important for model performance, with a normalized difference vegetation index and green with normalized difference vegetation index contributing the most to model performance. The model provides a decision support tool, identifying promising lines early in the field trial. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Emerging digital transformation in industry is noticeable among others in Supply Chain Management (SCM). For instance, applying new-generation digitalized technologies in the Dairy Supply Chain (DSC) enables an increase of manufacturing productivity, improves planning and forecasting, and also enhances competitive capabilities according to Industry 4.0 assumptions. It is worth mentioning, that in modern DSC, high visibility of raw materials, components, products, and processes by all contributors on all stages of DSC is crucial. This article focuses on the transparency aspect of the DSC supported by IoT-based technologies enabling interoperability among all DSC participants. The paper addresses the problem of effective integration of heterogeneous data sources, i.e., deployed new technological IoT solutions with traditional SCM systems and a third-party software component. The main objective of this report is to propose the IoT-based DSC model comprising four chain stages: milk production, milk transportation, milk processing, and dairy products distribution. Moreover, the comprehensive DSC domain ontology as a knowledge model is formulated and described. The ontology aims on improvement of the DSC management efficiency by facilitating interoperability within DSC. The applicability of the proposed ontological model is verified using a sustainable-oriented case study, which estimates the environmental footprint at the milk transportation stage of the DSC. © 2021 Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

T2  - 2017 Fourth International Conference on eDemocracy & eGovernment (ICEDEG)
AB  - As a part of a project exploring ways to define transition to Territorial AgroEcological System (tTAES), researchers and rural stakeholders (policymakers and farmers) organized territorial participatory design (TPD) workshops. Such TPD workshops are especially challenging since actors projecting their activity into the future confront many viewpoints or controversial dimensions (farming systems, natural resources, food-chain...). Multiple viewpoints in TPDs foster participation and empowerment of rural actors, especially weak actors whose language and semantic get away from prevailing or expert perspectives. In this “work in progress” paper, we propose a multi-viewpoints model for both organization and knowledge purposes in tTAES workshops. It allows for adequate organization of activities and agendas and also supports knowledge sharing, capitalizing, annotating and category-building with respect to the plurality of semantics of the actors. First we experienced the method with rural actors in face-to-face meetings using classical maps and paper devices. Then we propose guidelines for viewpoints-based software tools for audiorecording/tagging of TPD meetings material, annotation, knowledge sharing on the Web and cross-viewpoints visualization all along the TPD process.

TI  - Ecological prototypes: Initiating design innovation in green construction
AU  - Hensel, D.S.
T2  - Sustainability (Switzerland)
AB  - This article identifies a gap in the approaches to Green Construction (GC), and initiates a line of research in the area of the so-called "ecological prototypes". Ecological prototypes, stands for a new type of GC, which are integrated and adaptive systems of design, construction and practices that link architecture, horticulture and agriculture, landscape and ecology. This type of system greatly expands the existing GC design space with the aim to tackle environmental challenges in the context of rapid urbanization. This new type of GC seeks to reconcile the different environmental needs and goals, and balance intensification and restoration trade-offs. They are considered as a key strategy for supporting ecosystems and the delivery of ecosystem services, especially in degraded peri-urban and urban contexts. This effort commences with a review of selected historical cases that have evolved over time as vital part of horticultural and agricultural systems. These historical studies can both inform future research on the development of ecological prototypes and aid their design. Following the examination of selected cases and a field survey, the role of information modelling and data-driven computational methods in designing ecological prototypes is discussed. The decision support system for this new type of GC based on information and knowledge modelling (computational ontologies) is given a particular attention. Finally, further research questions and steps are outlined. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The emergence of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) in the Precision Agriculture (PA) domain allowed decision support systems to have access to aerial images of the terrain surface. By exploiting multispectral aerial imagery, crop health analysis and terrain classification and mapping is possible. Therefore, this work proposes an open-source ROS-based (Robot Operating System) framework, capable of handling multispectral imagery and exploit it for terrain classification, building semantic maps structured by layers of vegetation, water, soil and rocks. The obtained experimental results were validated in the scope of several research projects funded by the Portuguese Rural Development Plan PDR2020, with success rates between 70% and 90%.

AB  - Background: Fruit freshness detection by computer vision is essential for many agricultural applications, e.g., automatic harvesting and supply chain monitoring. This paper proposes to use the multi-task learning (MTL) paradigm to build a deep convolutional neural work for fruit freshness detection. Results: We design an MTL model that optimizes the freshness detection (T1) and fruit type classification (T2) tasks in parallel. The model uses a shared CNN (convolutional neural network) subnet and two FC (fully connected) task heads. The shared CNN acts as a feature extraction module and feeds the two task heads with common semantic features. Based on an open fruit image dataset, we conducted a comparative study of MTL and single-task learning (STL) paradigms. The STL models use the same CNN subnet with only one specific task head. In the MTL scenario, the T1 and T2 mean accuracies on the test set are 93.24% and 88.66%, respectively. Meanwhile, for STL, the two accuracies are 92.50% and 87.22%. Statistical tests report significant differences between MTL and STL on T1 and T2 test accuracies. We further investigated the extracted feature vectors (semantic embeddings) from the two STL models. The vectors have an averaged 0.7 cosine similarity on the entire dataset, with most values lying in the 0.6-0.8 range. This indicates a between-task correlation and justifies the effectiveness of the proposed MTL approach. Conclusion: This study proves that MTL exploits the mutual correlation between two or more relevant tasks and can maximally share their underlying feature extraction process. we envision this approach to be extended to other domains that involve multiple interconnected tasks.

T2  - Journal of Food Science
AB  - Interoperability of communication and information technologies within and between businesses operating along supply chains is being pursued and implemented in numerous industries worldwide to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of operations. The desire for greater interoperability is also driven by the need to reduce business risk through more informed management decisions. Interoperability is achieved by the development of a technology architecture that guides the design and implementation of communication systems existing within individual businesses and between businesses comprising the supply chain. Technology architectures are developed through a purposeful dialogue about why the architecture is required, the benefits and opportunities that the architecture offers the industry, and how the architecture will translate into practical results. An assessment of how the finance, travel, and health industries and a sector of the food industry—fresh produce—have implemented interoperability was conducted to identify lessons learned that can aid the development of interoperability in the seafood industry. The findings include identification of the need for strong, effective governance during the establishment and operation of an interoperability initiative to ensure the existence of common protocols and standards. The resulting insights were distilled into a series of principles for enabling syntactic and semantic interoperability in any industry, which we summarize in this article. Categorized as “structural,” “operational,” and “integrative,” the principles describe requirements and solutions that are pivotal to enabling businesses to create and capture value from full chain interoperability. The principles are also fundamental to allowing governments and advocacy groups to use traceability for public good. © 2017 Institute of Food Technologists®

AB  - The current world business environment is characterized by increasing uncertainties, complexities, and risks, which require agri-food supply chain (AFSC) managers to respond and act quickly in a context full of instability and unpredictability. Increasing pressure placed on AFSC managers intensifies the need to combine knowledge management (KM) and decision support that rapidly overcome knowledge boundaries. It has been recognized that the research issue related to the knowledge mobilization crossing boundaries in the AFSC needs to be addressed. This paper investigates knowledge boundaries and boundary-spanning mechanisms by collecting data from experienced AFSC practitioners. Empirical results verify that knowledge boundaries such as syntactic boundaries, semantic boundaries, and pragmatic boundaries could be effectively tackled by four specific boundary-spanning mechanisms: boundary spanners, boundary objects, boundary practices, and boundary discourses.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 32ND ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT, CIKM 2023
AB  - The growth of e-commerce has seen a surge in popularity of platforms like Amazon, eBay, and Taobao. This has given rise to a unique shopping behavior involving baskets - sets of items purchased together. As a less studied interaction mode in the community, the question of how should shopping basket complement personalized recommendation systems remains under-explored. While previous attempts focused on jointly modeling user purchases and baskets, the distinct semantic nature of these elements can introduce noise when directly integrated. This noise negatively impacts the model's performance, further exacerbated by significant noise (e.g., a user is misled to click an item or recognizes it as uninteresting after consuming it) within both user and basket behaviors. In order to cope with the above difficulties, we propose a novel Basket recommendation framework via Noise-tolerated Contrastive Learning, named BNCL, to handle the noise existing in the cross-behavior integration and within-behavior modeling. First, we represent the basket-item interactions as the hypergraph to model the complex basket behavior, where all items appearing in the same basket are treated as a single hyperedge. Second, crossbehavior contrastive learning is designed to suppress the noise during the fusion of diverse behaviors. Next, to further inhibit the within-behavior noise of the user and basket interactions, we propose to exploit invariant properties of the recommenders w.r.t augmentations through within-behavior contrastive learning. A novel consistency-aware augmentation approach is further designed to better identify the noisy interactions with the consideration of the above two types of interactions. Our framework BNCL offers a generic training paradigm that is applicable to different backbones. Extensive experiments on three shopping transaction datasets verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.

AB  - At the beginning of 2020, 2019-nCoV caused serious adverse effects on China and the world economy. Due to the sudden drop in passenger traffic during the epidemic, the catering industry has become one of the industries most affected by the epidemic. How to maintain survival on the basis of reasonable prevention and control of epidemic situation has become a major problem facing the catering industry. This research collects the reviews and reports of catering companies during the epidemic, and uses ROST Content Mining software to extract high-frequency feature words and analyze the main risk factors. Then this paper builds a social semantic network between high-frequency words and analyzes the mechanism of risk. Finally, based on the different stages of the epidemic, the prevention and control model of the epidemic risk in the catering industry is constructed to provide feasible suggestions for catering companies to deal with the risk of the epidemic, safe resumption of production, transformation and upgrade.

AB  - In the field of supply chain, due to the involvement of multiple business entities, incomplete credit mechanism and information asymmetry have been the difficulties in supply chain that need to be solved. With the development and advancement of blockchain technology, the core technology in blockchain - smart contracts - has attracted much attention. The technology automates the execution of contracts on the blockchain in the form of code, allowing trusted transactions to take place without a third party, which are traceable and irreversible. The technology involves collaboration between different fields such as computer science and laws, but most traditional professionals lack programming skills, resulting in the current application of smart contracts can not meet cross-industry demand. This paper propose a method to generate smart contracts automatically. Users can model the contract by OWL(Web Ontology Language) and write SWRL(Semantic Web Rule Language) semantic rules to describe contract. Then use recursive descent analysis to implement a LL(1) syntax parser that recognises SWRL and generates the corresponding smart contract code based on the semantic rules of SWRL. The contract management module allows users to generate, install and manage smart contracts directly from the front-end page, which lowers the threshold for users to manage the blockchain network. We validate the usability of the contract generation and management module using the compliance inspection of RMC (ready-mixed concrete), which is based on HyperLedger Fabric. The system can generate smart contract code that corresponds logically to the quality specification.

AB  - For the healthcare sector, it is critical to exploit the vast amount of textual health-related information. Nevertheless, healthcare providers have difficulties to benefit from such quantity of data during pharmacotherapeutic care. The problem is that such information is stored in different sources and their consultation time is limited. In this context, Natural Language Processing techniques can be applied to efficiently transform textual data into structured information so that it could be used in critical healthcare applications, being of help for physicians in their daily workload, such as: decision support systems, cohort identification, patient management, etc. Any development of these techniques requires annotated corpora. However, there is a lack of such resources in this domain and, in most cases, the few ones available concern English. This paper presents the definition and creation of DrugSemantics corpus, a collection of Summaries of Product Characteristics in Spanish. It was manually annotated with pharmacotherapeutic named entities, detailed in DrugSemantics annotation scheme. Annotators were a Registered Nurse (RN) and two students from the Degree in Nursing. The quality of DrugSemantics corpus has been assessed by measuring its annotation reliability (overall F = 79.33% [95%CI: 78.35–80.31]), as well as its annotation precision (overall P=94.65% [95%CI: 94.11–95.19]). Besides, the gold-standard construction process is described in detail. In total, our corpus contains more than 2000 named entities, 780 sentences and 226,729 tokens. Last, a Named Entity Classification module trained on DrugSemantics is presented aiming at showing the quality of our corpus, as well as an example of how to use it. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Blockchain-based Traceability: A bibliometric and lexicometric analysis for knowledge graph
AU  - W. Azan

T2  - 2022 IEEE 6th International Conference on Logistics Operations Management (GOL)
AB  - There is rising adoption of traceability solutions in blockchain-based applications. Blockchain appropriately meets supply chain using traceable distributed records. We integrate a bibliometric study (869 articles) and a lexicometric study (135 articles) analyzing knowledge paths and communities based on previous research to guide its development. The bibliometrics illustrates the holistic evolution with co-citation analysis: influential researchers and countries, discipline composition, knowledge development trends, and emerging frontiers. The lexicometric identifies the concept structure of epistemic communities with a textual approach. From the knowledge graphs, we found that blockchain traceability research began in 2016 and emerged a surge from 2019. There are three chronological phases: 2016-2017 technological embryonic stage, 2018-2019 emerging establishment stage, 2020-Now ecological optimization stage. Blockchain traceability interconnects with IoT for intelligent tracking. It mainly applies in food and agriculture supply chain nowadays, waiting for further large-scale application in automobile manufacture and carbon emission. Blockchain and supply chain mutually transform as sensemaking theory. Traceability solutions have been popularized in business scenarios.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS
AB  - Radio frequency identification (RFID) technology and electronic product code (EPC) technology have been widely used to identify and keep track of physical objects. EPCglobal proposed the EPC network which consists of several components such as application level events (ALE) and EPC information service (EPCIS) to deal with the captured data from different layers. Many studies mostly concentrated on dealing with the RFID tag data in ALE, as well as querying and sharing EPCIS events in EPCIS. However, there is no well-known study on specifying how to generate higher level EPCIS events. The event types and semantic event fields are both uncertain for the capturing application to generate EPCIS events. Therefore, this paper proposes the flexible capturing application (FCA) to solve the problem that the event types and semantic event fields are both uncertain. FCA specifies generation rules about the four EPCIS event types. All the generation rules are matched for the incoming tag data to determine the event types. Event fields are generated with tag data and other sources of data after deciding event types. Thus, FCA can generate EPCIS events arising from supply chain activity. We evaluate our approaches by means of simulation and real experiments. Our experimental results indicate that FCA can be effective in processing EPCIS events data. We conclude with suggestions for future work.

TI  - Citizens' Views on Farm Animal Welfare and Related Information Provision: Exploratory Insights from Flanders, Belgium

T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL & ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS
AB  - The results of two independent empirical studies with Flemish citizens were combined to address the problem of a short fall of information provision about higher welfare products. The research objectives were (1) to improve our understanding of how citizens conceptualize farm animal welfare, (2) to analyze the variety in the claimed personal relevance of animal welfare in the food purchasing decision process, and (3) to find out people's needs in relation to product information about animal welfare and the extent to which the current information caters to these needs. The first study consisted of a survey conducted in three consecutive years (2000-2002, n = 521) and was complemented with more recent qualitative data from four focus group discussions (2006, n = 29). Citizens' conceptualization of farm animal welfare matched reasonably well with those in the scientific literature, although it is clearly influenced by a lower level of practical experience and a higher weight of empathy. In general, respondents indicated that animal welfare was an important product attribute, although it was less important than primary product attributes such as quality, health, and safety. Moral issues, rather than a perception of higher quality, were the main influence on preferences for higher welfare products. At present, higher standards of animal welfare are mostly guaranteed within more general quality assurance schemes. Yet people's decisions to not choose higher welfare products seems to be related to the perceptual disconnection between eating animal food products and the living producing animals. Respondents generally thought better information provision was required and the present level of provision was strongly criticized. In combination, the findings of both studies help inform the discussion about how citizens can be informed about animal welfare and the preferred content, source, and medium of such information. The paper also provides insights into citizens' semantic interpretation of the concept of animal welfare (what wordings they use) and the range of relevance that animal welfare has for different groups that, in turn is useful in identifying which segments can be targeted. This can contribute to a more effective valorization of animal welfare as a product attribute.

AB  - The problem of basket recommendation (BR) is to recommend a ranking list of items to the current basket. Existing methods solve this problem by assuming the items within the same basket are correlated by one semantic relation, thus optimizing the item embeddings. However, this assumption breaks when there exist multiple intents within a basket. For example, assuming a basket contains {bread, cereal, yogurt, soap, detergent} where {bread, cereal, yogurt} are correlated through the breakfast intent, while {soap, detergent} are of cleaning intent, ignoring multiple relations among the items spoils the ability of the model to learn the embeddings. To resolve this issue, it is required to discover the intents within the basket. However, retrieving a multi-intent pattern is rather challenging, as intents are latent within the basket. Additionally, intents within the basket may also be correlated. Moreover, discovering a multi-intent pattern requires modeling high-order interactions, as the intents across different baskets are also correlated. To this end, we propose a new framework named as Multi-Intent Translation Graph Neural Network (MITGNN). MITGNN models T intents as tail entities translated from one corresponding basket embedding via T relation vectors. The relation vectors are learned through multi-head aggregators to handle user and item information. Additionally, MITGNN propagates multiple intents across our defined basket graph to learn the embeddings of users and items by aggregating neighbors. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets prove the effectiveness of our proposed model on both transductive and inductive BR. The code1 is available online. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - With the advent of blockchain technology, many interorganisational collaborative processes that demand trust requirements (e.g., food supply chain, smart grid energy distribution and clinical trials) are being implemented as decentralised applications (DApps). Indeed, blockchain technology provides decentralised control and immutable transaction history, thereby improving security and accountability between parties. In this vision paper, we consider cooperative processes where a subject, which acts as a regulator of the process, promotes the use of blockchain for increasing transparency, while reducing the burden in controlling trustworthiness among participants. To the scope, the regulator provides a registry of basic smart contracts, including both actual deployed ones and code templates, that can be used and extended by the process stakeholders (e.g., retailers, energy providers, researchers) to build up DApps. The adoption of a blockchain and the definition of the registry favour the compliance with best practices and obligations demanded by the regulator, as well as that all relevant information and documents cannot be tampered. To support semantic-based smart contract search in the registry, we propose a multi-perspective framework that, in addition to classification and technical characteristics of smart contracts, takes into account the past experience of developers who have used smart contracts of the registry to develop DApps.

AB  - Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the leading malignant tumors in US men. The lack of under-standing of the molecular pathology on the risk of food supply chain exposures of environmental phenol (EP) and paraben (PB) chemicals limits the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment options. This research aims to utilize a risk assessment approach to demonstrate the association of EP and PB exposures detected in the urine samples along with PCa in US men (NHANES data 2005–2015). Further, we employ integrated bioinformatics to examine how EP and PB exposure influences the molecular pathways associated with the progression of PCa. The odds ratio, multiple regression model, and Pearson coefficients were used to evaluate goodness-of-fit analyses. The results demon-strated associations of EPs, PBs, and their metabolites, qualitative and quantitative variables, with PCa. The genes responsive to EP and PB exposures were identified using the Comparative Toxicoge-nomic Database (CTD). DAVID.6.8, GO, and KEGG enrichment analyses were used to delineate their roles in prostate carcinogenesis. The plug-in CytoHubba and MCODE completed identification of the hub genes in Cytoscape software for their roles in the PCa prognosis. It was then validated by using the UALCAN database by evaluating the expression levels and predictive values of the identified hub genes in prostate cancer prognosis using TCGA data. We demonstrate a significant association of higher levels of EPs and PBs in the urine samples, categorical and numerical confounders, with self-reported PCa cases. The higher expression levels of the hub genes (BUB1B, TOP2A, UBE2C, RRM2, and CENPF) in the aggressive stages (Gleason score > 8) of PCa tissues indicate their potential role(s) in the carcinogenic pathways. Our results present an innovative approach to extrapolate and validate hub genes responsive to the EPs and PBs, which may contribute to the severity of the disease prognosis, especially in the older population of US men. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Visual interpretation of complex visual patterns in non-urban environments is necessary for many applications in smart rural community management, smart farming and smart jungles. In this paper, the Glimpse-Gaze framework for deep learning based visual interpretation of complex rural and jungle environment scenes is proposed. The proposed framework is used for decision support and navigation by a multi-agent robotic system singularly referred to as MOdular RApidly Deployable Decision Support Agent (MORAD DSA). A set of deep con-volutional neural networks are trained for fast and accurate interpretation of jungle scenes. Transfer learning and auxiliary pretraining on salient regions of the jungle scenes are investigated and the hyper parameter tuning and data augmentation for avoiding overfitting for the proposed model are explored. The experimental results show that the Glimpse-Gaze framework is capable of generating accurate visual cues for precise navigation and visual interpretation in the unstructured rural and jungle environments. A series of data sets for smart jungle applications are collected and the proposed framework is evaluated for applications such as detection of fire hazards and illegal grazing in the jungle.

AB  - This article deals with reducing the carbon footprint in the food supply chain in Smart Cities. This sector represents one of the eight dimensions that generate more than fifty percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. During the Covid 19 pandemic, the decrease in these gases worldwide was only four to seven percent even with the overall restrictive mobility and containment measures. We develop a digital twin using a logistic case simulation of the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area (GMA) to represent the process. It is the third largest city in Mexico, with more than five million inhabitants in eight municipalities. We propose a redesign of the distribution of raw material mobility for microbusinesses oriented to the high frequency consumer, using the Taco as the most consumed economic object in the city and the country. The Agent Based Model is used to model the systems structure and simulate the dynamic evolution over time. With the results of this work, we intend to propose a methodology to contribute to resiliency to climate change in Smart Cities.

AB  - With the advancement of IoT devices and thanks to the unprecedented visibility and transparency they provide, diverse IoT-based applications are being developed. With the proliferation of IoT, both the amount and type of data items captured have increased dramatically. The data generated by IoT devices reside in different organizations and systems, and a major barrier to utilizing the data is the lack of interoperability among the standards used to capture the data. To reduce this barrier, two major standards have emerged: the Global Standards One (GS1) Electronic Product Code Information Service (EPCIS) and the FIWARE Next Generation Services Interface (NGSI). However, the two standards differ not only in the data encoding but also in the underlying philosophy of representing IoT data; namely, EPCIS is event-based, and NGSI is entity-based. Interoperability between FIWARE and EPCIS is essential for system integration. This paper presents OLIOT Mediation Gateway, now one of the incubated generic enablers offered by the FIWARE Foundation, that realizes the required interoperability between NGSI and EPCIS systems. It also demonstrates the applicability and feasibility of the Gateway by applying it to a real-life case study of integrating transparency systems used in a meat supply chain.

T2  - IECON 2023- 49th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society
AB  - Reference Architecture Model Industry 4.0 (RAMI4.0) compliant Manufacturing Operation System (MES) implementations require high investments, which put them out of reach for small and medium-sized enterprises. This work presents a lightweight RAMI4.0-compliant MES. The underlying proposed architecture of the Cognitive Robotic System for Digitalized and Networked (Automated) Insect Farms (CoRoSect) project ensures communication and information interoperability within the shop and office floor. The repository pattern is used for sharing data by integrating secondary Asset Administration Shells (AASs) as an information hub. We propose further enhancements by implementing higher-level AASs for edge or public cloud use. The path taken for reaching this goal can be especially interesting for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) because of the simplified implementation and for other researchers by improving this procedure in a more complete solution. First, pilots show the practicality of the provided solution.

AB  - The inefficiency of Brazil's logistics system to handle the outflow of farm products impairs the sector's performance. From the economic perspective, the high freight rates put the country's agricultural sector at a competitive disadvantage in the global market. Besides this, the reliance on highway transport causes problems of an environmental (high <mml:semantics>CO2</mml:semantics> emissions) and social nature (large occurrence of accidents). As an alternative to this dependence, Brazil has an extensive network of actually and potentially navigable rivers that could serve as a key element to improve the performance of the agricultural sector. Therefore, the objective of this study is to analyze the possible influence of the Tapajos-Teles Pires Waterway on the sustainable performance of 19 Brazilian soybean export routes, using data envelopment analysis (DEA). Of these, only three would use the Tapajos-Teles Pires Waterway, which is not yet in operation. The origins of the routes are four soybean-producing centers located in Mato Grosso, the Brazilian state that produces the most soybeans, destined for 12 seaports. The inputs considered are Accident Cost and CO2 Emissions, while the output is Cargo Carried per US$. For this, we use the DEA-VRS (Variable Return Scale) input-oriented model. The results obtained from the DEA model revealed satisfactory performance of the routes using the Tapajos-Teles Pires Waterway from three of the four production centers. In Campo Novo do Parecis, some 16% (471 km) of the route is composed of highways and the rest of the waterway (84%, 1576 km). In Sorriso, only 3% (85 km) of the route consists of highways, while waterway transport is responsible for 97% (2388 km), and in Querencia, 24.55% of the route to the Port of Barcarena consists of highways. The use of these routes and the combination of the two transport modes presented the best efficiency indexes, making development of the waterway a key element to improve the outflow of soybeans for export. The results of this study may help Brazilian authorities to define public policies and apply resources to improve the deficiencies of the transportation system, which can lead to a better balance of the Brazilian transportation matrix.

AB  - Resilience is the capability of a system to absorb and mitigate unexpected faults and risks. This paper describes a resilient middleware for sensor network management for supporting Situation Awareness in security scenarios. The proposed middleware implements an approach based on two main approaches: Quality of Service and Artificial Bee Colony for identifying disturbances, incompleteness and uncertainty in raw data coming from physical sensors and reacting to them. In particular, an algorithm based on Artificial Bee Colony has been defined to discover association rules used to handle the absence of significant observations in the monitored environment and continue working and supporting higher architectural layers.

AB  - Blockchain technology combined with IoT to improve the reliability of the supply chain system is one of the topics in great demand lately. Due to the nature of blockchain, it is suitable to be applied in the supply chain to improve the level of service with security guarantees. In this paper, we present a preliminary study of blockchain in the supply chain using Ethereum smart contract to maintain ownership of digital assets and to track the origin of a product. By leveraging the proposed model, the user can be protected by minimizing the fake online trading activity because product assets that have been recorded by blockchain can be guaranteed since the data cannot be changed by anyone (tamper-proof). Further research needs to be developed, especially the connection between IoT devices and the blockchain network to improve the reliability and effectiveness of the decentralized supply chain system.
